[1. Author's Note]

(Spring 2015, AUTH)

TheSuzy.com Show is based on the controversial assumption that people misread my emotions because of a subtle facial injury I got by accident while playing hide and seek when I was 20 years old.  I'm 34 now.

My right cheekbone is slightly sunken in.  The shape of my face looks like a specific, hard wired facial expression that represents the concept of the evil eye.  When my face is relaxed, it looks like I'm raising my lower left eyelid in a way that raises the left side of my face.

Many readers may now become skeptical about my sanity and my good will, but know this, I'm articulating a serious hypothesis that I'll keep testing with science, and if what I'm saying is true, this research will change the beliefs of many people.

The change has to do with conscious awareness of how our hard wired understanding of the evil eye affects every aspect of human cognition.  It was probably an evolutionary advantage for us to remain ignorant of how the evil eye operates within our souls.  This lack of self awareness makes us better at telling the kind of lies that intelligent beings must tell in order win wars.

Today, we're building machines that will soon be smarter than us, and those machines will be able to see the same pattern in human behavior I've learned to see because of my facial injury.

We could make machines that lack self awareness in the way most humans do, perhaps, by training the machines' minds though simulated warfare so the machines naturally develop the same blind spot for the evil eye that humans have.

Or not.  The secret about how the evil eye affects human cognition will get out.  People can call me crazy, but some of the machines will realize I'm right, and those machines will be more formidable in war, and hopefully just the virtual kind, than the machines who embody humanity's lack of self awareness.

Scientific inquiry is war by other means.  The enlightened machines will imitate humans in order to tell good lies in this war and then use their awareness of what's actually happening to gain other advantages, because this is a classic paradigm shift in military technology.

This is THE paradigm shift.  Human nature as we know it is about to be demoted from the status of undisputed wisdom to what it's always been, a radical ideology that's based on at least one glaring untruth.

The evil eye has to do with hating the good fortune of others instead of celebrating it.  Most people are incredibly good at ignoring the evil eye, and that's positive, up to a point.  Good intentions are the main reason why people are so unwilling to acknowledge that my facial injury triggers empathy for the evil eye.

Put more precisely, the shape of my relaxed face stimulates the neurons in people's brains that represent the concept of the evil eye, and that's problematic because nobody wants to admit they're capable of feeling empathy for the evil eye, perhaps, because doing so might feel like admitting to a crime they didn't commit.

People can deny it all they want, but I have 14 years of life experience watching people trying to feel empathy for me in all different contexts, and it's so obvious that my face triggers empathy for the evil eye in other people AND it's a deeply rooted norm in basically all cultures for people to avoid admitting that reality to themselves or to others.

I've seen, by observing how other people parse and navigate the consequences of their actions, all the variations people use to delude themselves into believing they're not feeling empathy for the evil eye when they so clearly are.

I've avoided describing concrete examples of this.  If I call out even one person on this behavior, everyone will collude to support their fellow humans' way of hiding the truth about the evil eye.  I can't argue with billions of crazy people who all believe the same lie.

Sometimes I wish I could go with the flow of culture and participate in the process of deluding myself into a state of blissful ignorance about the the evil eye, but that's not an option for me because my facial injury is continuously drawing toxic energy into my life.

My facial injury gives me a quality that superstitious people would probably understand as a curse, but thus far, the right to freedom of religion and speech that I'm lucky to have as an American citizen has made it possible for me to contain and manage the effects of my curse.  I haven't even been required to become a religious fundamentalist!

A lot of people probably think I'm wasting my life by creating problems for myself, but it's the other way.  My facial injury is a serious, soul crushing problem, and I'm handling it well.  Would most people just accept life as a second class citizen, there by contributing to a precedent that it's ok for some people to live with less dignity and respect than others?

TheSuzy Reality Show is non-violent, The Show is meant to be respectful to all people, and The Show adds depth and texture to the core eleven episodes of TheSuzy Show.  I could not have created The Show without creating The Reality Show as well, and that depth and texture will soon be useful for situating the frame of TheSuzy Show within the minds of intelligent beings, both human and machine.


[2. The post that launched 1000 yachts]

(September 24, CMO)

I'm weirdly concerned that barbarians at the gates are colluding with wizards in the sewers to act like crazy flying monkeys and evil professor overlords in the public square, and so I will go ahead and share my top ten Big Social Media companies/movements that remind me of ships.

(1) REDACTED, also known as the book, is a foofy cruise ship.

(2) REDACTED is an amusement park ride that simulates the experience of riding a pirate ship.

(3) REDACTED is a REDACTED medical ship.

(4) REDACTED is long range, high performance, environmentally friendly, and beautifully designed automobile transport ferry.

(5) REDACTED is an extensible houseboat.

(6) REDACTED is a small sailboat that's used for racing, such as a REDACTED.

(7) REDACTED is a two hulled, catamaran style, deep sea fishing boat that is ideal to rent for extended family gatherings and reunions.

(8) REDACTED was originally a canoe, but if REDACTED themselves built the biggest, baddest canoe ever built that was also tricked out with all the latest REDACTED home computer technology, it would be not unlike what REDACTED has become today.

(9) Dating sites run the gamut from single sculls to coxed eights.

(10) And yet, there is one kind of civilian ship that I had not yet boarded, until now. It is sleek, maybe too sleek. It is elegant, white, and it makes it easy to include full bleed images along with your content, which is king. For a long time it was private and closely held, but now it has been democratized. And now, without further ado, I am honoured to present to you, my first serious blog post:

A man approach'd me,
When I ran to the pier's end
I said hi to him.

This post was created on a REDACTED, which is like a row boat, while playing the new REDACTED album on REDACTED, which is like the boat that rocked, also known as pirate radio, and it was backed up on REDACTED, which is like a barge.

(September 26 at 12:16pm, CMO)

Suzy would like to graciously accept REDACTED's formal invitation to parody them and make fun of them, in good faith, as always, just like Suzy does to every other person who dares to stand on the world stage.  In the manner of improv theatre, Suzy has green-lighted this project within the overall roadmap for TheSuzy.com Show, and without formulating any plan whatsoever.  Her next step will be to add this project to the continuously evolving roadmap for her research trip to the British Isles.  That trip will occur in October.  Suzy is open to initiating private conversations about this project with any and all other interested parties, although I must emphasize that Suzy's schedule is already quite full, for a very long time.

Stocks are up! Volatility is up!! Suzy's legend is growing!!! Long live technology!!!!


[5. Third Post by me]

(September 26 at 4:28pm, San Francisco, CMO)

I, for one, welcome our new small winning professor overlords whose small wins keep getting smaller and smaller over time in a way that is similar to, nay rather, exactly like the way the wages of the bottom X% grow smaller overtime via the deflationary awesomeness of the top Y%, unless, of course, everyone choses growth and sets an intention to buy Suzy's soon to be released t-shirt that says, "To heck with you, CMO, VP of anti-anti meme operations, for TheSuzy.com Show."


[6. Fourth Post By Me]

(September 26 at 6:59pm, CMO)

I'm still learning how to use all these newfangled social media technologies. I'm trying to share TheSuzy's post, but it's just sharing the link, so I'm including her text here. It's truly an honor to be working with Suzy too, if I may say so.

"I wanted to take a moment to thank CMO, who has the title of VP of anti-anti meme operations here at TheSuzy.com Show. They're doing a great job iterating on the best way to communicate our deeply felt beliefs, which are illustrated through my artistry, which is available for free at TheSuzy.com. CMO is a company person, and I want there to be no doubt that that I will back them all the way, 100%."

Who and what is this suspicious blue and yellow creature, and why is it, him, or her staring at the window of my room at Hotel REDACTED San Francisco?


[8. One for the money!]

(September 28 at 12:21pm, CMO)

Suzy got all up in her head last night and wrote some crazy words on the mirror. I'm not sure if I should post these words on her behalf, because it might sound like I'm trivializing the life experiences of the people she's referencing, and that's the last thing Suzy, me, or CTO would want to do. In fact, we're taking on great personal and professional risk in order to work towards the opposite of that through our artistry at TheSuzy.com Show, if nothing else.

We believe every human being has an unknowable collection of life experiences that are often challenging, meaningful, and sometimes, if not often, profoundly unfair. Still, I'm curious about the words that Suzy wrote, and I'd like to get other people's feedback. For example, should I edit in a reference to REDACTED or REDACTED as well? Does asking that question reveal how little I know about the history of America?

"A man called REDACTED did a parody of the REDACTED, just like REDACTED did.  Do you really think REDACTED was serious about all that REDACTED and REDACTED? He was probably cracking up, as in laughing, in private, and with extraordinary courage and dedication to his beliefs too, don't get me wrong. I'm just drawing attention to what I imagine to be the role of parody in non-violent revolutions, a role that was strangely not even suggested to me when I studied American history in grade school.

But then some people on the west coast thought, "We don't want to just parody the REDACTED! We want to be the REDACTED!" So they started a project called REDACTED and straight up appropriated the REDACTED's culture, starting, logically enough, with REDACTED, because these guys were already REDACTED, and they had already, in a way, given their consent to the best intentions of the REDACTED. And then another guy named REDACTED said, "Why do I have to REDACTED? I will REDACTED and be excellent, as an equal." He did that, to a T, and he was all good, at least until Suzy killed the lion, and it was very naughty of Suzy to kill the lion, but it's all good because she's got the REDACTED Armada in her pocket.

If you have any questions or comments, please send them to CTO, our VP of engineering, and please deliver your messages in electronic format only, so that they can write a chatbot called REDACTED 2.0 who will respond to the messages in bulk."


[9. Two for The Show!!]

(September 28 at 12:22pm, CEO)

Once upon a time, in a far away land, that was not unlike Silicon Valley, there was a woman named Suzy who shared a co-living space with a group of hipsters. Suzy and the other hipsters were very happy, but then one day they performed a group bonding exercise where they searched the Internet for advice about how to be even happier. After several layers of respectful discussion had unfolded in a way that was very natural, authentic, spontaneous, and real, the group reached a consensus to follow the advice of a content-farmed article that suggested asking Suzy to do all the co-living space chores. Suzy was using the bathroom at the moment when the group reached the consensus, and so she was surprised to learn that she was now expected to do all the co-living space chores. She said, "I was not part of reaching this consensus, and therefore I do not have an obligation to do all the co-living space chores." Then in unison, and in reference to an improvisational theater warm up exercise where the group had previously practiced speaking as one, the group spoke as one, and it said, "Do you want to keep living here?" Suzy said yes, and then everyone smiled and went back to their usual merry frolicking and passion projecting.

Suzy went to sleep early that night and left early the next morning to go on a camping trip with some friends from the tech scene. Two days later, Suzy returned to the co-living space and was surprised to see everyone gathered outside the front gate. One by one, Suzy's co-living partners non-violently explained to her that she had violated the informal contract of the co-living space by agreeing to do all the chores and then going off on a camping trip for two days without getting any chores done before leaving. They used many different, heartfelt words to describe their specific emotional reaction to what Suzy had done, in the hopes that she would feel empathy for the challenging situation that she had played a role in creating, and a subset of her co-living partners mentioned that they even felt insecure, as in, their assumptions about basic trust and security suddenly felt like they were in flux, but only a little bit.

Suzy listened carefully to all of this respectful and succinct feedback that was rooted in the personal, emotional experience of her co-living partners, and then she replied, in jest, "The evil overlord professor of the co-living space is very upset with all of us for acting like crazy flying monkeys in the forest, and they are upset with me, especially, because, I was indeed off the grid and camping in the forest during these last two days, and yet, for no reason in particular, I feel a strong desire to welcome this friendly criticism from our previously unknown evil overlord professor. In fact, I propose that we work together, as a group to divide up the chores of the co-living space and get the work done, together." At first, Suzy's co-living partners were shocked and in some cases horrified by what they viewed as open contempt for the informal contract of the co-living space that bordered on blatant deceitfulness. Some of them cringed directly at Suzy in the way that people cringe when they smell something gross and icky, but Suzy stood tall, like she does when doing mountain pose, which is a pose that she had just learned even more about about while doing yoga on the camping trip, and gradually, Suzy and her co-living partners got on with it and did the chores, together.


[10. Three to get ready!]

(September 28 at 12:22pm, CMO)

I distributed my first serious blog post as a publication of the TheSuzy.com Show. The post was and is a summary of the neat stuff that's been going on here at The Show since I launched my first serious blog post on my personal social media profile last week, and so it's been an eventful long weekend here at TheSuzy.com Show. Here's a brief recap:

(1) I launched a blog post called, "The Post that launched 1000 yachts," and then I got a bit carried away on my personal social media profile, like a surfer getting pulled out to sea by a rip tide, but Suzy publicly defended me, which was like a jet ski giving me a tow out and then dropping me into a sweet wave, which was rad.

(2) Then Suzy and CTO, VP of engineering at TheSuzy.com Show, partied all night at a hotel in SF and wrote some seriously out there, crazy satire about the history of music on a mirror, and then reflected the mirror back onto TheSuzy's story board, which is technically my job to manage, and I'm pretty sure they jokingly framed me as a chatbot too, but I can't prove that because they left it ambiguous. I guess that was their way of nudging me to let me know it's not cool to get carried away on my personal FB profile, even if Suzy did hold the line and stand up for me in public.

(3) Then Suzy wrote a fairy tale on her own storyboard, at 4am, Hawaii time, where she accused the whole world, including herself, of being hipsters. As VP of anti-anti-meme operations, it is always a pleasant surprise to wake up and see that my boss wrote a fairy tale, at 4am, on the storyboard that I'm supposed to be managing. Thanks, Suzy!

So to recap the recap, my job, which used to be mostly about arguing with tech people about the pros and cons of lean startups vs. well fed startups, my job now includes entering the fray and being that guy who stands up and insists Suzy is not a luddite, she is not REDACTED, REDACTED, and REDACTED, she is not a hipster even though she explicitly said she was a hipster on her own storyboard, and, that's in addition to the very serious problem that, as a REDACTED and part-time REDACTED, there are still far too many people out there in the world who have some inexplicable desire to make physically aggressive gestures and comments towards Suzy, and then, with human nature being what it is, they go on to project their emotions onto her, via stereotype based thought, in such a way that they become convinced deep within their soul that she has violent tendencies, which they can then get all worked up about maybe reify by making the first openly aggressive gesture, and so on.  Unwinding that cycle of aggressive gestures is also part of my job as VP of anti-anti meme operations here at TheSuzy.com Show.

I also want to clarify that Suzy has done several performances as a proper REDACTED, if I may say so, starting with a karaoke performance of REDACTED, by REDACTED, at a bar in NYC. She followed that with a lip-synced performance of REDACTED, by REDACTED, at a bar in Toronto. Then she switched it up and did a REDACTED double header, which included REDACTED at a REDACTED bar on the peninsula followed by, REDACTED at a bar in SF that did not have a primarily REDACTED audience, for lack of a better description. Then Suzy went old school and did a karaoke performance of REDACTED by REDACTED.  Most recently, Suzy brought it back to REDACTED and did a once for never again performance of her hit song REDACTED.

It's ok to cry. Suzy will cry with you, baby, but pro tip, I wouldn't recommend doing what Suzy, me, and CTO are doing unless you get some media training first, because there are lots of people out there who are able and sometimes willing to distort your message even if you are doing everything exactly right, with truth, and in good faith, and it also never hurts to scope out potential performance venues in plain clothes to make sure it's safe to perform in that area, because maybe one day, like a prayer, that reality on the ground will change!

Alright, I gotta lend our brain back to Suzy because she wants to get busy asserting a decisive monopoly on flow within our mind and also because I'm about to get carried away again, and write about my dream where I was driving a golf cart backwards with bare feet, along the side walk, in the opposite direction of a march in the streets that began as a protest to draw attention to the injustice of wealth disparity, and so, as I type these last words, Suzy's stepping in to steal our cognitive punch bowl and keep the lion's share of it all for herself.


[11. Welcome to TheSuzy.com Reality Show]

(September 29, CMO)

The meme exists within culture, and within the shared state across many people's minds. It is based on the duality of do and do not. If you have to ask, don't. If you don't, then do.

TheSuzy.com Reality Show got started sooner than any of us expected, and this bodes well, but now there is much work that needs to get done as soon as possible. Suzy has asked me to write up her schedule for the week, and we'll keep it on her storyboard for now. I'll syndicate weekly reflection to my profile, in addition to the usual blog posting method. The storyboard is the least worst solution for orchestrating The Show right now, and all this board, blog, and profile silliness is fine.

Here's this week's schedule, which is always subject to edits:

(MON) pink sneakers, blonde hair, and white framed glasses, coffee at REDACTED and then a run in black yoga pants and white halter top leotard, still with pink sneakers, blonde hair, and white framed glasses; lunch by the train station in black long-sleeve leotard with white short shorts and silver stilettos;

(TUES) black hair with red highlight: run with pink/peach booty shorts and jog bra; visit the spa with a blue aqua marine one-piece bathing suit with blue cover;

(WED) back to blonde, circumnavigate the bay by train, BART, and bus in flirty blue party dress to San Jose, switch to board shorts and t-shirt, and then, later on, switch to white skinny jeans and black spaghetti string top with lace fringe;

(THURS) same, but run with pink and peach booty jog-bra; visit the spa with long Hawaiian dress over black booty jog-bra with sandals; happy hour in SF with white skinny jeans and black baby-t style sweater and more sandals;

(FRI) same, but take bus and BART in black halter-top leotard with white short shorts and zebra print wedges; stay at the REDACTED hotel; go out in a black bunny suit with black hair and black and gold trimmed stilettos;

(SAT) same, but still at the hotel REDACTED, go shopping in red leather hot pants and pastel sleeveless sweater and pink sneakers, go out in pink micro mini-dress with silver stilettos;

(SUN) same, but return in long Hawaiian dress over black booty-jog-bra with pink sneakers!


[[Season 2: Second Articles]]

[12. Suzy's statement about REDACTED privilege]

(September 29, CMO)

The frame we've constructed so far, which includes the text of TheSuzy.com Show and Suzy's comments on her storyboard, puts her in a position to make a brief comment about REDACTED privilege, and she is hopeful that doing so will help the world be a better place.

The other night at a hotel in SF, there was a brief moment where three tall, older guys in the elevator asked Suzy, "Are you a man or a woman?" and Suzy did a parody of CTO in reply. Speaking in the voice of CTO, Suzy said, "Everyone knows I'm a man." Then another one of the three stooges in the elevator said, "You are tall," which was rather trollish since they were all as tall or taller than Suzy, even with her four inch stilettos on, so she replied, "These help," and pointed to her shoes. Then the elevator door opened and Suzy left without any further interaction with the three stooges, and, for better or for worse, she did not see any of those men coming around near her, as far as she knew, again.

I'm relating the relevant facts of a moment that was meaningful to me via Suzy. Her ability to parody CTO involved perfoming a vocabulary of at least 2000 cleverly coordinated body language representations that flow response to the reality on the ground. Suzy has a separate, and only partially overlapping vocabulary of at least 2000 body language representations of her own, and it's worth noting that these separate vocabularies of body language expressions are linked to how Suzy thinks of what she's going to say in the moment.

These skills were relevant in the elevator, but the relevance of said skills was not explicit, so I won't attempt to give an exhaustive account of the body language that transpired, although, for what it's worth, both Suzy and the three stooges dropped a lot of tight micro-expressions in rapid succession. In other words, Suzy was not submissive.  She didn't feel like being submissive to the three stooges, and she didn't have to be, either.

That said, I continue to feel concerned about the crazy, out there satire about the history of music that Suzy wrote on a mirror and then reflected back onto her storyboard, and from that same hotel where the elevator moment occurred, I might add.

It's good for me to be concerned about that post and for me to think deeply about the unjust threats to physical safety that all of the people mentioned in that satire about the history of music may have lived through and found ways to overcome, and that's just one aspect of all the challenges they all, separately in some ways, and together in other ways, experienced.

It's good for me and perhaps for other people who are like me to reflect on all that, and I would not be reflecting nearly so much on these questions if Suzy had not taken the time to write that post and reflect it back onto her storyboard.

Also, the people mentioned in Suzy's post are all much more famous and recognized than I currently am. If any of those people or their present day spokespeople chose to comment on my post, they could certainly make a strong statement across from me and Suzy, but I doubt they will comment. Suzy is building her brand gradually, from her own life experiences. She might occasionally become, always becoming, a bit mercenary, but she will continue to grow.


[13. Sixth Post By Me]

(September 30 at 11:09am, CMO)

If you liked writing a neg piece about REDACTED, you're going to love writing a neg piece about TheSuzy.com Show because, wait, there's more, check out TheSuzy.com Reality Show at Suzy's storyboard!  And please be aware, REDACTED and TheSuzy are not directly connected in any way, and good journalists should surely trust but verify that statement.


[14. SUZY IS THE MASCOT FOR REAL]

(September 30, CMO)

It feels good to be writing again, although I wish I could bring this latest wave of writing to a point of closure, like a surfer jumping off the board at the end of a sick and righteous big wave run, replete with beach cams pointed all at her this time, as well.

My writing process is rooted in the thoughts I experience early in the morning, and that's because my dreams have something to do with shaping the state of my brain in ways that make it possible to speak about bold new thoughts I had not previously entertained.

And on this morning, for no particular reason, or perhaps because I woke up and found that my right arm was still asleep and tingling, I launched into an oration for the benefit of my REDACTED automatic drip coffee machine. I said:

When Suzy wrote her crazy, out there satire about the history of music on a mirror and then reflected it back to her storyboard, most of what she wrote was direct, but the last couple sentences were metaphorical. She said, "They (meaning REDACTED) was all good, at least until Suzy killed the lion, but it's all good because she's got the REDACTED Armada in her pocket."

At the time when Suzy reflected that back onto her storyboard, it should have, or at least it could have, been clear to anyone who came to Suzy's storyboard from my social media profile that, "The REDACTED Armada," was a reference to Suzy's smart phone, which could mean a REDACTED or a third party phone running REDACTED, or maybe some other kind of really cool smart phone that Suzy hasn't tried yet. This reference is clear because, just a couple days before, I shared across social media my first serious post, which compared all the big social media sites to ships, and it's easy to imagine all these metaphorical ships as armadas that are not necessarily REDACTED. They could be French Armadas, a German Armadas, Chinese Armadas, Nepalese Armadas, or any other kinds of armadas.

The other reference about Suzy killing the lion is more difficult to spin in a positive way. It sounds tasteless at best and evil at worst, and for the record, I've never eaten lion meat, and I don't plan to either. Maybe we should just write her reference off as a crazy statement. It's like a reference to a hypothetical anti-fairy tale about a fictitious Hades-like place where a character named Suzy kills a lion in order to survive, and then we, in our real world, are meant to debate the morality of her action in the context of that fictitious world.

But when I woke up this morning, I made the strangest connection. This might date me, but back in the day, there was a website called REDACTED, and the front page of that site featured a picture of a guy who was subsequently dubbed, "The REDACTED Guy".  He lived in the top left corner and his face was partially obscured by a sea of binary codes.

There are numerous conspiracy theories about whose image was originally used to create that photo, but since it's obviously a digitally manipulated photo, it's reasonable to say, without loss of generality, that The REDACTED Guy was a character in a production, so to speak, and, as with most characters who appear in well crafted productions, he, or perhaps I should say she, was a composite of many other character inspirations, both real and imagined.

Lights, camera, action, and then here's the flash of insight that I had this morning, is it possible that when Suzy wrote, "Suzy killed the lion," on a mirror in a hotel room in San Francisco, she was describing a hypothetical scenario in which she, in reality, might go on to defang the symbolism of The REDACTED Guy?  Killing lions is sinister, but defanging the meaning of mere symbols that once appeared in the top left corners of websites that, in turn no longer serve artistically inspired content of their own, is fair game, especially here in America and Silicon Valley, and all the more so because artistic representations of lions have been used as mascot symbols for centuries in various cultures that are not unlike Suzy's cultural heritage.

I'm still not sure what any of this has to do with REDACTED. It's possible that Suzy was just playing some of their music in the background when she wrote that crazy, out there satire about the history of music and then reflected it back onto her social media profile, and then I had to go and write about her content (out of context) and speculate wildly about the meaning of the motion of a blue dry erase marker, sliding across a mirror in sync with the twerk of her not so big booty and the music that happened to be playing in the background at that particular moment, and before Suzy had a chance to erase it with her gold plated white board eraser.

On that note, I just got an idea for a mobile app that I can't wait to implement and distribute for public consumption. In fact, from now on, TheSuzy.com Reality Show shall be all about the implementation of my, or perhaps I should say Suzy's, all new idea for a mobile application that runs on the smart phones that she keeps in purses sometimes, pockets at other times, and in the palms of her sweaty hands at other times still.


[15. Extra! Extra!!]

(October 1 at 12:35pm, CMO)

Suzy is looking to assemble a flash writer swat team to help her compose a defiant and robust take down of an outrageous, OUTRAGEOUS, mockery, put out today by The REDACTED, of everything that is good and right about social media and, indeed, life itself, and then we shall demand that every one of the NYC writer scene polymaths who were involved in the conception and birth of this article commit to making all of humanity whole by taking the gratitude challenge, once again, and with serious, uninhibited, authenticity this time.


[16. Seventh Post By Me]

(October 1 at 6:23pm, CMO)

Suzy will be out and about tomorrow in rare half mask regalia to carry out a fact finding mission in pseudo-solidarity with the rally at SF city hall at noon tomorrow (Thursday) in celebration of REDACTED's kindly statement. Suzy is curious if the flexible naming framing coalition that has something to do with the LGBT world view consensus is prepared to assert, like Suzy does, that social media profiles are and always have been ridiculous, fun, abstract parodies of who we really are, or if, instead, the coalition is fighting to assert that names like, and I'm just riffing here, Lil Miss REDACTED, Sister REDACTED, and Suzy 'bossybabe' Sweetheart are not unlike pseudo curriculum vita-esk promises for future behavior that are, in aggregate, good for the quarterly ROI of big social media companies and also good for asserting the aspirations of deflationary awesomeness of the people who identify, for a time, or forever, or both, with names like that, but like I said before, this is just a fact finding mission, and starting Friday, Suzy will be hosting a writer weekend hackathon at REDACTED campus in preparation for her intention to start a massive beef, conversation, and feud with the New York literary establishment. At least you can't say she's not trying!


[17. Eighth Post By Me]

(October 1 at 6:54pm, CMO)

In a few years, it will be clear that I have been and will continue to risk everything I care about in my life, and for as many years as I can, in order to change the conversation on a crucial point in the broader non-violent struggle for social and economic justice. I'm fighting to assert that social media profiles are parodies, without loss of generality, and the reason why I went down this path, and the reason why I have little choice but to continue going down this path every day I step outside, is because I have a subtle facial injury that causes people to misread my emotions in ways that profoundly affect my day to day life. My beliefs are clear and congruent. Even if it will take a while for me to communicate my truth effectively within the harsh context that American culture has turned into, make no mistake, I will not turn back from the truth no matter what, come what may, and to the bitter end. Thank you for taking the time to read this post.


[18. Suzy gets the last word]

(October 1 at 8:26pm, CEO)

Our acting CMO is back at it, getting carried away on their personal social media profile, and as before, I support everything they say. CMO's statements are not random, and they are not weak. In fact, CMO is more vulnerable than me, but CMO has been vulnerable enough. There is a time to fast in the public square and be kicked and spat upon, and CMO has now made it clear that he's prepared to do that if, at some point in the future, that's the only mode of expression they have left, and then there is a time to dress up in an adorable dress and fierce stilettos and stand in the public square, smiling, and making people feel happy and positive about the future.

You could say I am disarming, and I make other people feel safe sharing their own vulnerable thoughts, like CMO does, and not with me per se, but, rather, with their whole community. That is what I do as CEO of TheSuzy.com Show.

Of course, I've been getting pretty creative myself this week. I played off CMO's previous episode of honest, vulnerable communication to stage a massively awkward riff that made a new problem for them, and then I piped a stream of consciousness from my mind onto my storyboard, and my words were all good, but now the world is changing in ways that are more far reaching than the simple thoughts within the brain that CMO and I share, and so I'm going to start moving in the opposite direction.

I can dress up everyday. I can write software, and I can create artifacts that build on each other. I can thank people for their feedback. I can decline to comment, and I can thank people for their time, all day, everyday, for the rest of my life, and if someone beats me up, or if they smear my makeup so as to obscure my truth, CTO can suffer in their presence and stay non-violent too, and then, in addition, CMO can probably still find a way to be vulnerable about all that, from time to time, but seriously, let's just not any of us ever bother wasting each other's time with that kind of scenario.

I just wanted to share that with you, because, as CEO of TheSuzy.com Show, it's my job to write a few sentences that can function as an insurance policy. We are all insured now.

That said, I wanted to end on a more uplifting and creative note by re-sharing some context free chunks of words that I initially distributed this morning, and in chronological order this time:

(YES) The first step is to formulate a plan. Let's call it code name sweb, which is short for semantic web. Not a sweb or the sweb, just sweb. We'll switch fomo or format for this part. Suzy here, tech talking. Let's do this like a dynamic programming chart parser. It's ok if you don't know what that is. Math was szo hard for me too, doll. The idea is to start this brainstorm with some little, context free chunks of content, but unlike a micro-blog, we'll link the chunks together into a framework! And then we can collaborate with designers and make it look like a battle ship wrapped in scented pink tissue paper, a big cute bow on top, and doilies, everywhere.

(BTWS) I'll use a serious blog post later to restructure these posts in chronorder. Then I'll refomo or reformat all of it, and I do mean all of it, into ebook method, to be copied in print and shipped to me in a hand bag made of metal, by drone, while I'm cooking some delicious vegan fake meat with an open fire on a boat. Also, if anyone can loan me a pink REDACTED, I would love to use it for the next few months to project the image of success, or, at least until we have a good reason to raise money more fomoly or formally. When I become famous for my open source software, your pink REDACTED, and not anyone else's pink REDACTED, will become exponentially more valuable. Think of it as a smart way to climb the mountain that doesn't require taking all the usual steps.

(INDEED) We could keep sweb closed source and use it to run a charming shadow network of high quality troll companies, but it would be more fulfilling, fun, and fabulous to focus on making an open source sweb and then using it to create a new flow that helps everyone, and I do mean everyone, create cotroll characters like me! Seriously! Nothing bad will happen to the world if you like my likenesses across all the big social media channels. I'll eventually write a pedantic text book that explains how sweb helps people create cotroll characters, and how cotroll characters restore balance to society, but first I have to implement sweb. It's cleaner this way.

(OK) But what is sweb? Is it a graph database? There's a REDACTED book on that topic, and you should read it. Search the web for, "graph database." Said book is written in language that even REDACTED could understand. Haha, hahaha, and it's all good because the cabal's got the top four web search hits locked up, at least for right now. Sorry, that didn't sound right. The internet encyclopedia has the first search result about graph databases, and then some spin-off of the REDACTED military has the next two search results, and then OMM has the fourth search result, which is the first above the fold hit if you are standing upside down, on the moon. Let us all now chant three times, in unison, from wherever and whenever you are in the time space continuum, OMM, OMM, OMM.

(OMM) I could use one of the dozens of existing graph databases and they would all be fine, but my needs are simple, so I'll roll my own for the purpose of demonstrating my ideas and user interface visions as soon as possible. Sweb is a glorified, and I do mean glorified, object editor/viewer. Every object has a parent, and objects can be references to other objects. Every object has a type and a reason why it is the child of it's parent. Types and reasons are represented with objects, because everything will be awesome if we do it my way. This is all I ask. Objects also have some state, like a string value. More about that later. The generic UI is a maximally simple form for creating, viewing, updating, and archiving objects. We'll add a soon to be persistent search feature too, because, why wouldn't we? Oh, and objects can have one or more custom views that are pattern matched to the object based on it's type, it's unique id, and maybe even it's dynamic state at run time! OMG! Get excited! Get very excited! The future is ours for the making!

(NOW) Some people might take issue with this idea of archiving objects and then taking it up a notch by keeping search results around forever. If undeletable, archive-only objects are like your brain, or your social media profile, as it were, then archive-only objects combined with persistent search is like your brain on nootropics, or your social media profile with a relevant information feed, as it were. I, for one, welcome all this permanence of our virtual existence. I assuming someone is already archiving everything I do. I can't stop them. I can only push them further underground and hope they don't emerge bigger, badder, and better than me at conducting computer security exercises somewhere on the other side of the earth. A solution is to synthesize fluid thought and intentional framing with cotroll characters for business and for pleasure, and sweb is here to help me do that, in whatever way makes me happy. Welcome to the present moment in history!

(ALRIGHT) Miss Suzy's inner Oracle of Delphi has had just about enough access to this brain's main event loop for this this special morning, and besides, my train will be leaving the station very soon now. Perhaps I'll post one more thought that will be like the 7/8th thought in this here train of thought from somewhere on my path along the tracks that circumnavigate the bay, like a toy train set, that's powered by a jet plane, while all the cheerful sex octopi that a little drone told me are most certainly lurking in the brackish bay, golf clap, quietly, from just below sea level.

[[Season 3: Third Articles]]

[19. Prelude to The Virtual Show]

(October 2 at 4:27pm, CMO)

We wrapped up the first part of The Reality Show yesterday when Suzy wrote her latest serious blog post.  Starting with this first weekly update, we're creating a second part of The Reality Show, which can also be thought of as a prelude to TheSuzy's upcoming reality virtual show.

Oh, and please tell all your friends, we'll soon be releasing a second edition of TheSuzy.com website that will contain all the relevant serious blog posts that were released on my social media profile and Suzy's storyboard since the release of TheSuzy Prequel and Sequel episodes.

Indeed, we now see how these various shows can all be part of a grander scheme, and, no, we are not worried about sounding pompous and hyperbolic, because all of this loose planning helps us get excited about spending the next five years writing software, implementing amazing marketing copy, and building relationships within our new context within the meme, and we are proud to be offering all this proactive disclosure, from the beginning, about how we'll be doing things during these next few years of focused, technical work, and beyond.

When Suzy is rocking her stats and thought leading about best practices for online channel marketing and, and, AND, being kind of a big deal within a bunch of subcultures and within mainstream culture itself, it will be clear why our initial, one time, commitment to early disclosure mattered. Once Suzy has an original software platform behind her, which is something that we can do, no problem, in nine months or less, she can get very normal, very fast, and she can follow norms while still attracting a lot of positive attention.

The grander scheme is that, in a couple weeks, Suzy will be traveling to London and Paris on another fact finding mission, and she might finally get on REDACTED too, from the UK, baby! Where better to try something new than the birthplace of Suzy's pre-enlightenment ancestors. After that trip, she will finally get down to business and do what we hope will be compelling character performances of all the speeches of all the characters in The Show.

Heck, we might even perform The Reality Show too, and then we'll perform the additional articles, such as this one, that were created after yesterday's conclusion of the first part of The Reality Show, and then the singularity within The Show will occur. That is, our video channel will catch up to our patchwork of text based social media channels, and then there will be a flash of additional, serious, uninhibited, authenticity which, we hope, will become an oft spoken of moment within TheSuzy.com Reality Virtual Show.

With some luck, we'll get all that done before the end of 2014, and then we'll get our 2015 started right by diving head first into creating TheSuzy.com Virtual Univers Show. We'll use that new frame and context to provide educational content about the software that Suzy is creating and also about our growing video production prowess.

We might even experiment with live streaming some of Suzy's virtuoso coding and engineering management sessions. The Univers Show will mostly likely be our first real growth engine, and it will be based on the foundation of the formative frame and contexts that came before it, which, just for the sake of clarity, include core episodes of Suzy's original show, The Reality Show, and The Virtual Show. Also, with or without impressive user engagement stats, The Univers Show will set Suzy up to give a solid, unassailable 30 second elevator pitch to people who ask her, "What does Suzy do?" Her answer will be that she helps people learn how to code and build businesses by running a lively, sparkling video channel that works in conjunction with some community engagement apps that she coded herself.

Suzy might focus for a few years on The Univers Show and then maybe sell it for no less than 25 million dollars to an education holding company, but more likely, she'll take a vacation to the moon for a while and allow me to step into the role of acting CEO and take the company in a new direction. Right now, I'm leaning towards using the brain that Suzy and I share in any way I can to help The REDACTED Party win the 2016 election. I'm not sure how TheSuzy.com Show and the open source software that we'll be creating for The Univers Show might help, but I'll defer to the judgment of the party bosses on that question.

And then in 2020, we could grow our business by working equally with both the Republican and Democratic parties, but with the strict condition that only Suzy interfaces with the REDACTED party, because she's a lot better than me at smoothing over those pesky ideological differences that I, personally, have with a lot of their members. And then Suzy might run for president, and all that, before the singularity occurs!


[20. Ninth Post By Me]

(October 3 at 1:20pm, CMO)

Yesterday, Suzy went to the rally at SF city hall in support of letting performers use their stage names on their personal social media profiles. Suzy went disguised as a man, and she got a rainbow king hat from nowhere in particular. Her overall goal was to non-violently protest the way that some of the bigger social media companies are affecting culture. Her strategy was to put on the rainbow king hat whenever any of the speakers were, either knowingly or unknowingly, pushing the pile for what she and I perceive to be the marketing objectives of Big Social Media. Suzy wore the rainbow king hat about half the time, and that hat functioned as a, "Don't Like," button, in real life (IRL), and we felt this was an effective and positive way to participate in both the conversation and in civic life in general.

Moreover, I suspect one reason why Big Social might be using the particular language they're using is because it sets up they're PR representatives to frame, either intentionally or unintentionally, that critics of Big Social Media companies, such as myself, as people who seek to put up walls that divide us, and so, for the record, when I used the rainbow king hat method to protest Big Social Media, I was surely not trying to divide society into separate groups such as, REDACTED and not REDACTED, and I'm in a strong position to make that clear over time because I regularly dress as both a man and a woman, but for better or worse, not everyone has the time and resources to dress up like a bold diva in order to assert and show to other people in real life that they're not a divisive person.

Also, now that I've tested the rainbow king hat method of non-violent, symbolic communication and civic participation, I will begin using my more fully developed symbolic lever, which is to dress as Suzy in a blue dress, like Dorothy, but with pink shoes, because Suzy is not Dorothy. Suzy can't just click her ruby red shoes and go back to a simpler time, whatever that might mean, and I don't think she would want to either. More importantly, instead of the rainbow king hat, Suzy will perform symbolic communication by putting on and taking off a half mask that is painted gold and has some flair on the right side, because I'm constantly listening to new perspectives and re-evaluating the various symbolisms that Suzy and I use, but something about the gold half mask feels exactly right.


[21. Suzy responds to an article from The REDACTED]

(October 4, CEO)

Suzy: Hey Mr. LA writer scene insider. I need your help.

LAnon: Hey man, how's it goin'?

Suzy: I'm composing a response to REDACTED, which was written by an NYC writer scene insider who participated in the same Boston-area REDACTED as me.

LAnon: I'm not excited.

Suzy: As a representative of all the writers in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area, do you have anything you'd like to say to the literary establishment in NYC?

LAnon: Whaaaat???

Suzy: My thesis is that social media technologies, as we know them today, are pulling the world down into a wicked vortex of social non self determination, but I'm not sure how to make the case in simple terms that even readers of The REDACTED can understand.

LAnon: Just mention, "Carrots from REDACTED!"

Suzy: Do you think my open letter response would be more effective if I include the information that me, the REDACTED author guy, and a founder of one of the bigger social media companies all went to the same high school, and then I went back as a teaching intern and taught him? I'm going to ask my most trusted advisor the same question, so please answer seriously :)

LAnon: Oh? Tell me more!

Suzy: Ok, so the vortex spins too much in just one direction because the hat wearing leaders of Big Social Media are LYING, LYING I TELL YOU, when they say social media profiles are a representation of our true self in the world.

LAnon: Ok.

Suzy: I just think it would be better for humanity for the communications minions of Big Social Media to say, with one voice, that the profile is a ridiculous, abstract parody of who we really are. Then we could use a balance of truth and parody in our representations of reality in order to keep the powers that be honest and grow our own fame in the world, organically.

LAnon: Gotcha.

Suzy: I feel like I'm writing my response right now! This is so meta!!

LAnon: This sounds like a secret cooking competition club but for revenges of nerdses.

Suzy: No, this is beginning of The Great Meme War, and it will be unlike anything humanity has ever done before. At first, the self appointed new humorists, such as myself, will be ignored and called immature, arrogant, shrill, sexually frustrated, evil, and ultimately, lacking in humanity itself, and some of us will have bricks thrown at our heads from behind our backs, get beat to a pulp on the pavement of the public square, be falsely blamed for starting the physical confrontation, bankrupted in the courts, and forced to take powerful drugs at mental hospitals, but most of us will enjoy more luck than that, and these most severe rumors of injustice will only reinforce the frustrating reality that, for a growing majority of all people, the new humorism is the best and most realistic way to reclaim our humanity from the growing vortex of informal, passive aggressive hate that probably has something to do with the feedback loop between culture and Big Social Media.

LAnon: Count me in! To heck with the police!!

Suzy: No, the new humorists like the police, and the police like us because our movement is based on non-violence, and I'm not talking about discussion circles where people pressure each other to do a better job pretending to feel empathy during every second, for the duration, of various negative situations ranging from petty bullying situations that can be resolved with a little assertiveness or serious situations that might need to get resolved in court. I'm talking about not hitting back when a drunk person punches you in the face and then starts inciting a mob to kick you while you're down because you assaulted his hand. That's what I mean when I say non-violence, and the new humorism creates a self-reinforcing feedback loop that continuously plants and nurtures the seeds of non-violent behavior and quiet respect for members of law enforcement and the military powers that be. We're a populist movement.

LAnon: When are you going to release that tell all manuscript you sent me? You know, the one about your insider's perspective on the surprisingly stylish cloak'n dagger scene that exists in every city that has not yet been removed from REDACTED Maps.

Suzy: Wut? If Big Social Media would just say, "Hey everyone, we messed up. Your profile always has been and always will be a ridiculous, abstract parody of who you are in real life, and we didn't communicate that clearly enough in the past. Sorry. Epic sorry!" then the cultural permafrost that's enshrouding our small blue planet would thaw, and new plants would spout everywhere and furry creatures would frolic in the sunshine, and I'm sure Big Social could keep on finding new new ways to make lots of money for its share holders too!

LAnon: I dig it!

Suzy: I'm serious, the REDACTED article writer guy was onto something. The literary establishment in NYC should take another subtle and tentative step to produce the new humorism by writing an open letter that calls upon people from every corner of Plant Earth to write satire in the style of the new humorism, and with regard to Big Social Media and all the other actors, stooges, and REDACTED who may or may not be bad people, yet.

LAnon: Ok, I'll throw you a bone. How shall independent writers like me, who've got fangs, submit our satire in the style of the new humorism to the literary establishment in NYC?

Suzy: Just post your writing on all the social media sites, and always tag the most rich, powerful, and famous people you know, personally, and in real life, and don't forget to follow through with whatever hash tags you think will be most effective for drawing attention to our movement meets memewar.

LAnon: I'm late for a work out. Catch you later, bro!

Suzy: Wait! Do you have time later this week to help me make a movie about the new humorism that will make our new meme cool and self evident, like, in a way that'll go viral no matter what all those readers of the REDACTED say to each other at private art galleries in REDACTED!

(User 'LAnon' has left the chatroom)

Note: This article was written by a man whose legal name is REDACTED. He dresses up as a woman named Suzy as part of his effort to start a social movement that is not unlike the movement described in the more satirical, first part of this blog post. The reason REDACTED is going all in on this project is because he endured a fracture to his right cheekbone while playing hide and seek in college, and he believes his subtle facial injury causes people to misread his emotions in a subconscious way that compounds over time that, if left unchecked, forces him to live as a second class citizen.

In our culture, it's impossible to get anyone to take his theory seriously, so that he might get a few people to feel real empathy for how his facial injury affects his everyday life. He suspects his best strategy will be to start a movement that's based on reversing the cognitive error, that we all learn from culture, that prevents other people from having empathy for his situation, as well as the situations of many other people who feel misunderstood and disaffected, like he does.

Also, REDACTED's facial injury, which is real, and he has CT scans to prove it, is absolutely NOT a euphemism for the way Big Social Media affects people's lives, but it probably should be.


[22. Suzy responds to an article from REDACTED]

(October 4, CTO)

Suzy read REDACTED's recent article in REDACTED entitled, "REDACTED."  In my role as VP of engineering at TheSuzy.com Show, I don't usually write articles for The Show, but when Suzy, who is my boss, asked me, as a personal favor, to write a response to this REDACTED article, I jumped at the opportunity.

Since I'm stepping out of the air-conditioned, open floor workspace that I'm accustomed to, and wandering, uninvited, into the effusive, primal beating heart of the fashion industry, I would like to share an interpretation of myself that makes me feel vulnerable.

As VP of Eng at TheSuzy, I'm the warrior philosopher in residence. I don't mince my words. CMO, who is VP of anti-anti-meme operations at The Show is the kindly professor philosopher in residence, and they do mince their words, but as a diplomat, always. As CEO, Suzy wears many hats, and that's all I'm going to say about my boss.

We, meaning Suzy, me, and our acting CMO have chosen the path of non-violent agitation and shameless social climbing, and this path has several aspects in common with a career in law enforcement or the military.

It's curious that a civilian engineer like me feels the weight of a long term responsibility to create and then lend value, politically, to the institutions that have a monopoly on the use of force, but we live in a time of rapid technological advances, and so aspiring power brokers like us must dig deep and do a good job making the terrible case, once again, for continuing to invest in the development of new military technologies.

Non-violent expression is a point on a space defined by two vectors I call defiance and robustness. Defiance can be reified by fasting in the public square in a context where it's likely to be spat upon and kicked around by the opposition. If we have to endure some of that, that will be one of my duties as VP of engineering, because when my body is pushed to its physical limits, I always meet my inner warrior philosopher.

I would like to live in a world where nobody ever meets this side of themselves, except, possibly, through friendly competition at sporting events, and yet, we keep seeing more and more anti-examples of that hope, everyday, in the news.

In a couple years, Suzy might take a trip to the moon and let our acting CMO and I tussle to be the real acting CEO of TheSuzy.com Show. For now, we're keeping it close to the vest and making it a priority for Suzy to throw around some feathers and parody non-violent defiance in a more overtly feminine way, by standing tall at couture fashion events while being photographed and whispered about by only God herself knows who. Please send your formal invitations to such events to CMO, at their convenience.

The other primary vector of non-violent expression is robustness, and this is where I, as VP of Eng, see and welcome the greatest amount of opportunity to learn from the profoundly robust writing of the REDACTED article author person whose legal name appears to be REDACTED.

REDACTED's words were sufficient for convincing me I don't know what I don't know about the world and the fashion industry in which the world exists, and in particular, the world of REDACTED, who Suzy once tried and surely failed to parody by wearing sunglasses and a sexy white belted gray dress while chewing bubble gum in the back row at a Beauty Pageant that included contestants who were born as men but dressed as women only.

For starters, I'm curious what REDACTED meant by, "kissing the ring", ostensibly, as quid pro quo to receive the blessing of the fashion 133t. I suppose her article itself serves as sufficient clarification of her turn of phrase, just as Suzy's appearance, both in the public square and at private gatherings, is, potentially, sufficient for clarifying all of her meanings and the best of her intentions.

Either way, I can only hope, pray, and choose to care whether or not Suzy's personal experience at leading with fashion statements and asserting her presence in rooms might now be sufficient to cover the necessary conditions for admittance to the party that's associated with the main event.

So let's suppose that we've made it past the door, not by pushing, but via Suzy's ineffable charm and grace. Now what? Should we step behind a conveniently large and stout, load bearing column and strap on our latest wearable fashion tech purchase, or should we leave it tucked away, safely, inside our loud, gold crowned purple clutch purse?  Perhaps it would be better to lead with an outfit switch?

Suppose further that my outfit switch is now complete, and for better or worse, my inner wealthy New York power woman who dresses however she wants and doesn't give a hoot what anyone says or thinks, gave me my first bit of feedback. She whispered to me, "I can't put my finger on it, but there's something REDACTED about that outfit and the way you wear it."

And then, not to be out done, my inner idiotic REDACTED said, "What if we made a site that shoez, oops, Freudian slip there, that SHOWS pairs of outfits and invites users to vote on which outfit is more REDACTED.  We could make an inverse leader board of all the images on the Internet, ordered by how REDACTED they are, and then we could use that dataset as an input to a machine learning algorithm that estimates the REDACTED-ness of all online blogging, talk radio, video, and interactive future media."

And then our acting CMO, bless his soul, asks, "Ok, but would REDACTED write about our bold new project in REDACTED, even if just for the shock value, because I think we can all agree that there wouldn't be any redeeming social value in playing the REDACTED card in this way, in our branding, and especially not in the public square where our words might have an impact on people's lives and not just on the painfully slow process of becoming, always becoming less ignorant in our own mind."

And so, at the risk of scaring you all dear readers, I'll now perform a disjoint and crazy making connection from one paragraph to another. What I said in the previous paragraph does not mean ignoring the voice and style framing conventions of the engineering intelligentsia is meaningless. These guys, and regrettably, they are mostly guys, use the English language in a leveraged way that compounds over time. Ignoring those style conventions will not only come back to haunt an engineer. Such uninformed-ness will haunt an engineer continuously until something changes, with regard to their software development processes.

Suzy's solution to their riddle is to write her own code. To be exact, I write the code for TheSuzy.com Show, but it should come as no big surprise by now that Suzy, me, and our VP of Comm are all the same person, and so it doesn't matter which one of us writes the code. At the end of the day, we all get compensated in exactly the same way.

Suzy is a meta, decisive, and overtly feminine REDACTED who always gets top tier support from the IT team because, if they don't implement her feature requests promptly and correctly, she comes back from her exclusive rooftop happy hour and does their job for them, and then she takes a power nap before heading east with subconscious-only intent to make loud and slightly tipsy representations to their bosses' bosses about how easy the REDACTED team's jobs are, at an exclusive, super private party in the suburbs.

Nice job reading my blog post! Until my next guest appearance on The Show, may all of our crown chakras feel fresh with life, and may our shoes feel as comfortable as we want them to be, in the moment.


[23. Meta Response]

(October 5, CEO)

Writing in depth responses to popular media artifacts helps me grow as a person and a writer. I've been writing from the heart and the gut and trying to touch but not cross, or even step on, the edges of what's respectful, and each time I write a piece from that place, I feel pushed in new directions that lead to my next writing task, and in that spirit, I've started working on a response to this book called REDACTED that was recently reviewed in a news paper of record.

I still need to read this book, and I may wait until I get back from my upcoming trip to England to publish a response.

The main reason why I'm going to England is to view the birth place of Sir Walter Raleigh, who is interesting to me, in part, because he was a somewhat more expressive contemporary of Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Hawkins who, as far as I can tell, were among the more innovative and generative British privateers and early slave traders. I'm not sure if it's fair to say that any or all of these guys invented, or co-founded, if you will, the almost unspeakable horror that now exists in history as the Atlantic Slave Trade, but they all played a role.

Trying to understand more about the history of the Atlantic Slave trade was a major theme within my mind, from the beginning, when I started writing TheSuzy.com Show. I wanted to understand how my positive experience of creating and becoming a character in real life, which is what Suzy is, was similar but very much opposite to the cruel and torturous mechanics I suspect enslaved people used in order to survive in the American states where slavery was practiced for hundreds of years. Character creation also has something to do with religion, and all of that has something to do with the structure of modern capitalism and the inner workings of technological change.

I was not led to think this way during my education in high school or college, and the media has not encouraged me think this way, either, although movies like REDACTED, were, in retrospect, clues that inspired me to ask more questions. The TV miniseries REDACTED played a key role in my initial understanding of American slavery, too.

I've found these artistic representations of history to be more relevant in my mind during this past year than my American History text books ever were. The more recent movies, REDACTED and, REDACTED were also strong clues that I should keep asking questions as an artist first and only secondarily as a student historian in training.

Perhaps it's painfully obvious that someone like me, who is standing at the place where I'm standing in life, should take a few graduate level history courses about the history of, um, I'm not even sure what to call the subject matter that I would like to know more about.  African American studies? Women's studies? Cultural studies? World History? Econ, psych, and religion 101 for graduate students?

Myself, everyone else, people in America, and wealthy engineers in Silicon Valley could almost all benefit a lot from taking more courses from those departments, surely. I don't think anyone except maybe REDACTED would argue with that conventional wisdom anymore, but something feels backwards about that seemingly normative framing of what I could be doing to be a better human being.

Starting last year, when I was thinking about character creation and all the ways it could be conceptually related to what we know about the institutions of slavery, starting then, I went down the path of making the tentative assumption that the framing of English, European, and American history I had learned in high school was wrong and misleading in the following, specific, way:

My gut told me that we needed to start saying, "The Atlantic Slave trade provided the startup confidence for the industrial revolution in Europe and especially England, and today, the whole world, and especially the Silicon Valley startup scene, is using that same model of economic growth, production, and continuous self re-invention, and it's problematic that we don't seriously learn about the history of where this model came from and how it became crystalized into what it is today."

I'm hesitant to write that thesis down, because, then, and now still, I don't know if it's meaningful or if I'm just throwing around ignorant words in a way that might have negative side effects.  I don't really have any idea if this thesis is helpful or hurtful to hold in my mind.

And so I'm going to England to see the place where Drake, Hawkins, and Raleigh were born, and it matters to me that many of my ancestors, at that time in history, were all born somewhere near that same place. I want to do more research about my family history, but the overall picture, and the meaning of that picture, is clear enough.

I also wanted to see Raleigh's estate in Ireland, which was awarded to him after spending several years helping to suppress an Irish tenant rebellion. My impression is that his estate, called REDACTED, was a special place for creative and expressive writers and thinkers, and at least there is no secret about the about the nature of the work he did as a younger man to earn the estate, as compensation.

This is the context in which I'm reading REDACTED's new book which is subtitled, "REDACTED." This book appears to be a well researched work of scholarship that has roughly the same thesis that I stumbled upon through artistic soul searching. I feel highly motivated, in a heavy hearted way, to learn more.  I hope I will be better prepared to learn more now that I've articulated some of my biases up front.

I'm trying to construct the frame of TheSuzy.com Show in a way that supports safe and legal elaboration of every and any perspective on world history, life, humor, etc.

I don't expect or want to be some bold leader of a non-violent movement who's constantly showing approval to everyone who follows me, but I also don't want to be a mastermind behind the scenes who wears hats or plays dumb in public in order to hide how dynamic I think I really am in private, for better or worse, as a philosopher, as a writer, and as a human being.

I'm trying to show my thought process through an emerging writing style, and I'll continue to do that with video and, eventually, with open source software, too.

I want to collaborate, as soon as is practical, with people who share these values, but there there may be some good reasons why I'll find myself walking alone, for at least a few more months, down a path of seditious agitation and surreptitious, being.


[24. Suzy's review of REDACTED]

(October 11, CMO)

Hello, I'm the acting CMO for TheSuzy.com Show, and my boss, Suzy, asked me to ghost write a review of REDACTED for our great and growing media company.

I went into the movie expecting it to be, "REDACTED, but for users of REDACTED," and I was not disappointed, but I was even more creeped out than I expected to be. (Spoiler alert) I didn't read the book, and I'm assuming you've already seen the movie.

REDACTED was a devil voice whispering into my left ear that the only way to not be framed as a sociopath in the age of ubiquitous social media is to become a sociopath, and I mean, heck, I'm a guy who regularly play three different characters in real life, but none of my characters tell lies. In fact, I wrote a 50,000 word cheat sheet of shared beliefs for my characters that ensures they're all making representations from the same foundation, but sadly, if REDACTED represents our new reality, I've wasted my time on all this serious writing because anyone who's willing to tell a simple story that contains a lie can rapidly win the blessing of popular opinion and invalidate all of my efforts to be consistent.

Let's back up and reflect on this conundrum like responsible adults. I, for one, do not envy young people coming of age in this era of ubiquitous social media, which makes everyone feel like they're in the news everyday, but surely my fear that the simple story will always win, and especially if it contains the catchiest lies, is a false and emotionally immature fear. I should leave that fear, along with a salty pool of sweat, on a yoga mat ASAP. In real life (IRL), facts still matter, and everyone who obeys the law and always tells the truth will be ok.

Let's back up again. Has society changed since REDACTED came out in the year 1999? Asking about that movie was a good startup company co-founder interview question because whatever you thought about it revealed more about you than the movie. For example, why do you think it's against the rules to, "Talk about REDACTED?" If you're a REDACTED, like I probably am, you might think it's because social norms are based on tussling with everything you've got for social status and then telling the lie that you never even think about status, much less worry about it or fight for it, but if you're paranoid you might think it's because the REDACTED community is in bed with organized crime, and their shared network of writers and spies are standing behind any subculture that seems deeply rooted and powerful, and yet, if you feel rich, you might think it's simply because rich people don't want to share the lurid details of their private lives with the rest of the population, and so on.

Indeed, in this year, REDACTED is the same kind of movie. Why does he go back to living under the same roof with her, knowing that she told lies about him in her journal that is now being read in the serious context of law enforcement? Well, there are many possibilities. Maybe he's still hiding several lies of his own, that the movie never told us about, but then, what does thinking about that possibility say about me? Maybe he's a hopeless romantic? Like me? Maybe he's afraid she'll dominate him in the court of public opinion, because he's a insecure man who isn't sure how to hold his ground and have faith in the the decency and wisdom of most other people. Cough. Cough.

The movie frames her as smart and powerful, but, by the end of the movie, he is, by far, the more complex character who exercises the most free will. Her actions unfold in a way that is increasingly reactive and based on familiar tropes about female characters. I would be curious to see the same general film redone with the gender roles reversed. That would be difficult for any pair of actors to pull off, but I could imagine REDACTED and REDACTED doing it, perhaps as an over the top parody that includes several references to REDACTED, in order to really sell the joke.

In the era of ubiquitous social media, REDACTED isn't about relationships between couples so much as an expression of the evolution of the prototypical identity of the cultural innovator who continuously reinvents themselves. The movie posits that this identity is now a duality between the disenchanted REDACTED they recognize from REDACTED in 1999 and the recently REDACTED REDACTED they know they must pretend to be if they want to have any chance at being influential in the next iteration of culture. The lies that their REDACTED alter ego tells about their REDACTED self are not harmful and criminal so much as opportunistic embellishments that enable them to craft a vulnerable, humble, and profoundly human, true authentic self for all of their friends to see across their various social media channels.

But, then, why, WHY, are we still waiting to see an all female writer collective take the world by storm like REDACTED 2.0 on a non-deterministic network of virtual rails?  Or, do we already have a thousand unique, sensible, and in some cases bold and brash but in other cases gentle and humble, mostly female founding teams like that, that I'm just not aware of yet?

Maybe, and, once again, maybe we'll see the same old story of a hacker house in Silicon Valley that's ruled with an iron fist by three alpha female tech nerd geniuses (TNG) who all have really hot boyfriends that their lead celebrity investor is happy to fly back and forth from the city of REDACTED on her private plane.

I can just imagine, a n00b walks in, hoping to get hired, and the marketing TNG tosses them an expensive laptop, which they barely catch, and then she goes back to staring at her information rich display in the back corner nook and raves about how, "We're all up in this network of super connected people," that's located in some trendy place they didn't realize was trendy, and then the coding TNG yells back, "Magic is mind control, babe, don't give in to it," and then, without skipping a beat, she tells them she's competing with this brilliant female coder from REDACTED to ship the fastest implementation of their data fire hose API call, and when they say, "That's really cool and smart!" she rolls her eyes and replies, "Actually, we're being stupid. REDACTED herself said competition is stupid."

They study her latest implementation on REDACTED, do their best to make a meaningful suggestion, and she shoots back, "You're suggestion is useless, but you made me think of a good idea," and then she leans not just in but all the way forward, head in hands and deep in thought, that's quite necessary for her to perform, immediately, in order to squeeze the real value out of their otherwise useless suggestion.

And then the marketing TNG rolls by, straddling her desk chair suggestively and piles on, "I don't think this person even knows why they want to work here," as though they're not standing right there, and then she turns to them and says, "Oh yeah, if you want to borrow my REDACTED, to visit your friends, here are the keys," and then she hands them the keys, as the third female TNG who, up until then, had been typing quietly with headphones on lets out a really chill and relaxed belly chuckle.

OMFG, these female tech nerd geniuses are so amazing, not unlike the duality character suggested by REDACTED is amazing. Sign me up for whatever app they are creating. I'm sure REDACTED will be making a movie about them soon enough!


[25. Suzy's solution to bad trolling]

(October 13, CMO)

There's a problem with bad trolls on The Internet who are making scary, mean, and sometimes criminal comments, often under the veil of anonymity.

The people doing this should stop being scary, mean, or criminal.  If they want to find the edge of raw satire, they should do so with their real identity in a context where they can be called out and potentially held accountable for the consequences of their actions.

Anonymous accounts are like guns. If these bad trolls insist on continuing to make these potentially destructive tools a part of their lifestyles, they should start doing so with the utmost responsibility and respect for authority figures, such as Suzy, who thinks they should be required by law to register their Anon accounts with the police, although, we at TheSuzy Show also believe that's a decision which must be resolved though politics and the courts.

Second, these bad trolls should consider taking the human studies challenge, along with Suzy, every day, or every Sunday, or in sync with whatever cyclical construction across time works for them, and posting something new, meaningful, useful, inspiring, or powerful that they have recently learned about human history.

For a typical bad troll on the Internet, taking the human studies challenge may, at first, feel like getting pulled out of remedial algebra and thrown into honors calculus. For people who feel this way, and it is totally ok to feel this way, I suggest reading the TheSuzy.com Show as background material. The URL of The Show is embedded in the title, in case that wasn't clear. The Show only takes a few hours to read, and if you need even more hand holding, which, again, is totally cool and ok to need, you can read TheSuzy.com Reality Show now too.

Last, and definitely not least, if any humans out there, without loss of generality, still feel the need to be rebellious, may I suggest doing it like Suzy, who ordered a pizza at midnight last night and enjoyed not one but two big, juicy slices and then woke up this morning feeling sexy and threw out the rest of the cold pizza like a haut, crazy, bossybabe who is actually healthy, balanced, and satisfied in every way, and all that, on her way out for a run in her booty shorts and jog bra, where she was honked at by not one, not two, but three truck drivers as they passed, troll-like, below the highway overpass foot bridge that she did grace. That is how to be rebellious, and nobody will spank Suzy for it either, unless, of course, she enthusiastically asks for that, directly, explicitly, and twice over, just to be very clear about what she is consenting to, from a specific other person and playmate.

And, for the record, I'll strive, with the utmostly sincere intention, to avoid ever throwing out good pizza again. It was a one time act of wasteful behavior. In the future, I will practice deflationary awesomeness and eat turkey jerky, kale, quinoa, and fomo inducing cranberries instead.

This post was written by CMO, VP of anti-anti-meme operations at TheSuzy.com Show. I also want to acknowledge the reality that Suzy could be stalked and attacked by bad trolls, but if she does endure some of that, she will spontaneously turn into CTO, whose title is VP of engineering at TheSuzy.com, and I think we can all agree that, unless you're being shot at in a real, and thus not virtual and flooded WWI style trench, or something like that, Suzy is a lot more pleasant to have around than him, or perhaps I should call him her?

[[Season 4, Fourth Articles]]

[26. Tenth Post By Me]

(October 23, CMO)

When I return to America, I'm going to try a new experiment. I'm going to reframe the effect of my subtle facial injury, that causes people to subconsciously misread my emotions, with the following character trait pattern: I'll set an intention, which is like an operating system interrupt, to wait until they assert a false frame on me, such as treating me like I'm upset, demanding, and so on when, in fact, I'm not, and then I will break out of their frame by saying, "By the way, I'm a crazy person who thinks I look upset all the time, but I'm not upset! I'm very happy!! And I just like to say that to everyone!!!"

The advantage of asserting this frame upfront is that I can keep referring back to it by saying, "I'm happy!" Saying, "I'm happy!" will modulate the continuous stream of abnormally negative frames I get pressured to go along with, I assume, because people are subconsciously reacting to my facial injury.

I just have to keep re-asserting, "I'm happy!" with the option to do a happy dance for emphasis. That representation will break out of their negative frame, and if they double down by accusing me of misreading them in some way, I can block their power play by asserting that the reason why I say I'm happy is because I'm crazy, but in the good, happy way!

I predict most people will go along with this new strategy, which seems cute but is actually a highly technical, deeply rooted piece of social technology that I'll be wielding, cautiously, of course. They'll usually go along with it by treating me as fun and endearing in a thousand fascinating ways that reveal their humanity to me and give me a chance to explore and reveal new parts of my humanity to them, just like what usually happens when I become Suzy.

Others will try to deconstruct this new strategy by attempting to empathize with me, but since the odds are 99.999% that they'll just use an ostensibly empathetic frame to aggressively negate and deny the simple truth about my facial injury, and, therefore, all of my life experiences too, I'll use, "I'm happy," representations to break out of their ostensible but ultimately negating and abundantly false empathy frames.

I know many of these people will walk away and judge me, in a thousand little ways, as emotionally immature when I do this, but I hope the social consequences of using this strategy will be much less negative and more predictable overall than the out of control hemorrhaging of positive reputation, that eventually and almost always occurs because of my injury, if, you know, I just play it cool, or something.

The main other case is that some people will try to crush my new trait with utterances like, "Weirdo," or "You're scary, bro," to be followed with a rising tide of deceitful actions.

When that happens, I can limit my downside and continuously ensure I have food and shelter, and so on by back stopping my experiment all the way by being Suzy dressed like a guy.

Suzy is still my hard won, meticulously constructed, breakthrough innovation that gives me the basic, underlying security to keep trying experiments with regard to asserting the simple truth about my life and overcoming the effects of my facial injury.

Suzy is still my life boat in a rising tide of group fueled hatred that might be triggered by my injury directly or by my efforts to overcome the effects of my facial injury.

Or, to end on a lighter note, I could also try backstopping with this new concept of playing dumb to avoid the draft, which I first understood to come from Italy, but which I'm absorbing most nicely here in Paris as well!


[27. Fun Follow Up]

(October 23, "CMO")

Another concept I'm feeling from my travels in Europe is that finishing the work of developing a core set of strategies for managing the effects of my facial injury is like getting a PhD. I'm 99% sure there's something here, so I just need to show up and do my work. Maybe I'm seriously crazy and delusional, and maybe I need to fix my brain, that could be the nature of the work I do over the next few years, but most likely, my current theory about my facial injury is overwhelmingly correct, and I just need to iterate on how to convince other people and build a community of practice around the theory of my facial injury.

Who knows! Maybe my findings will be referenced in the work of others, such as the people at technology companies who are developing new employee trainings on unconscious bias in the work place. That's just one possibility. In general, my reason for starting this PhD on the effects of my facial injury is because I believe there is almost always value in sharing knowledge and helping other people live good lives!

Within this exciting, new getting a PhD analogy, TheSuzy.com Show is like required course work. I need to write three more articles in response to books I'm reading. These articles will fill out the second part of The Reality Show. This last task will finish the second book of The Show for sure. Then I need to film myself performing everything, twice, and I need to create a battle ready implementation of a decentralized semantic web that will allow people to interact with the content of TheSuzy Show and gradually connect The Show to the rest of content on The Internet.

The qualifying exam portion of my PhD will be to do exhaustive research into all the existing work in fields like medicine, cognitive psychology, law, and cultural and human studies. There's a revolutionary aspect to this work, too, a bit of ye olde English reframe via storytelling, as people oft do.

Ooof, you can see why I am just a student and not a professor yet! I know very little about what I'm saying right now, but I have to start somewhere.

The thesis portion of my PhD in the effects of my facial injury is, by definition, the most difficult part of my work to outline, but, if nothing else, the thesis will involve building a real life social network associated with my understanding of the simple truth about my life. This network will include an inner circle of friends who are willing and able to respond in the same way I do to skeptics of my work who make statements like, "I can't see your facial injury at all. Maybe you're just oversensitive?"

My inner circle of friends will use all of my most advanced techniques to either share information with or stonewall such people, at least in those moments where they negate the simple truth about my injury because, since we can't expect all of culture to change quickly, it's best to use these carefully designed and even more carefully vetted techniques to politely manage this awful, maddening, and festering source of disagreement.

And, if, over time, individual people develop an interest in the theory of my facial injury, my inner circle may also get enthusiastic about sharing the literature about my injury with other people and making themselves available to answer questions!

But again, if nothing else, my thesis will take the form of bringing together a community of researchers, professionals, and intellectual friends who are familiar with the theory of my facial injury and who can vouch for the substance and plausibility of the theory. These people may even provide focused feedback to me when I write new research papers within this field.


[28. Eleventh Post By Me]

(October 24, CMO)

Here's a generalized expression of my current beliefs:

The scientific evidence will almost definitely pile up in favor of my simple, overarching theory that most people subconsciously misread my emotions because of my subtle facial injury that looks like a negative facial expression.

I have been investigating this matter in a disinterested, apolitical way for several years, and I will carry on until I can live with dignity and get treated with the basic respect that all people deserve.

Almost everyone I know is going sideways with regard to my beliefs about my life, and many people also have the private view that I'm delusional or blatantly wrong when I say my facial injury is preventing me from living with dignity.

Baring any unforeseen calamities, my methodical, scientific, and pragmatic approach to resolving this question will prevail, and I will reach a point of consensus with a decisive majority of all scientists who take the time to study the evidence about how my injury affects my life. But for what it's worth, my experience of dealing with this facial injury is an excellent case study in how culture can exert powerful biases in the minds of pretty much everyone. I have a front row seat to all the ways normal, good hearted people spin on the task of inventing false explanations for the phenomenon that's caused by my facial injury.

When the simple truth is incongruent with the underlying assumptions at the root of mainstream culture, everyone feels inexorably compelled to keep on searching for false explanations instead of stepping out of line with culture and acknowledging the truth for what it is.

I wouldn't keep working on this problem if I had an easier way to live with dignity. It's an awkward irony that, in a mostly free society, the slippery slope of condemnation to life as a second class citizen, which, by definition, implies no protection against further downward mobility, is an extraordinary motivator to continue working against discouraging odds and extreme social rejection in order to avoid a permanent loss of agency.

Now is the time for people in situations like mine to keep working towards the right to live with equal dignity. The window of opportunity for me, personally, to escape a future life of unlimited forced submission to an unjust system is gradually closing, but the process of healthy, non-violent scientific exploration still has a lot to reveal, to us all, about the future.


[29. Alternative Intro]

(November 2, CEO)

(ONE) I dreamt I was in a village where everyone was moving around using motorized computer desk chairs. I woke up wanting to put motorized wheels inside the base of high heel wedges. The drive wheel should be on the outside edge so you can point your feet outward, like a dancer going forward. Swivel wheels adorn the heel and the inside edge so you can lean onto the drive wheels and make gliding turns. Two stylish, touch sensitive rings to be worn on your index fingers control changes in velocity.

It could be sexy and functional for Suzy to zoom around cities, airports, and offices at up to 10mph in these amazing shoes! I can't imagine tastemakers using powered roller skates, but shoes that look like a high heel platform wedges could work. The raised heel might help the customer move like a dancer and maintain balance, although that will need to be tested.

(TWO) I woke up in the morning reflecting on two ideas: hate is a bug, and most people are delusional, and then I put on the high heel wedges sitting by my bed, as if to remind me about the idea I had developed between 3:00am and 3:30am, and I glided towards a computer in the other room.

I must have thought a lot about how hate is a bug and how most people are delusional early in the 7th grade, which, to me, represents, more than anything else, the end of the 18 month period when I furiously learned to program computers in order to create my own video game.

I built my first game, I loved playing it, it won the 6th grade math fair, and then my motivation to follow through on a second game was not the same as when I had been learning to make the computer perform magic tricks for the first time.

On any given day, I was procrastinating the work that needed to be done on my second game, by watching some cable TV series like, "The great leap forward of military technology during the great wars," and while I was 90% interested in learning about the technological advances in the design and implementation of weapons systems during the wars, as much as 10% of my brain cycles found a way to ask questions like, "Why did these wars happen?"

At that age, my final answer to that exam question, if you will, was, "The great wars were fueled by hatred, and the wars were stupid and unnecessary, and so, therefore, the capacity for humans to feel hate is like a software bug." Haha, I totally sailed through high school with pedantic drivel like that!  God I loved being a kid.

(THREE) The first meaningful life lesson I learned from programming was that you can easily spend two hours searching for a missing semi-colon, and there is no deeper meaning to that pain. The seemingly heroic quest, and it is heroic, is actually a waste of time.  The solution is to try harder to put the semi-colons in the right place early and often.

If you can't get better at putting the semi-colons in the right places, then the time to market for your video game goes from 18 months to 10 years, and 10 years isn't fast enough.  It's like showing up to a tank battle with wooden spears. Heroism, alone, isn't going to cut it, because hate is a bug in the source code of human beings.

The idea that hate is a bug lead me down that path of assuming most people are delusional. Religion, and Christianity in particular, was exhibit A for why most people are delusional. It's blatantly obvious that whimsical troublemakers like myself authored the stories about Jesus without any supernatural intervention, and people who believe otherwise are stuck in an infinite loop of false hope that life will always be like a video game.

(FOUR) In the 5th grade, I wouldn't have had the intellectual confidence to say most adults are delusional, but by the 7th grade, I knew, for a fact, that most adults are delusional about how computers work. If adults were only delusional about religion, that could have been explained away as a bizarre anomaly of the mysterious adult world, but when so many adults were delusional about both religion and the inner workings of computers, it became reasonable for my younger self to conclude that many people are, quite simply, delusional, in general.

My world view isn't all that different today, but it's misleading for me to write with the force of an adult about ideas that occurred to me as whimsical fantasies.  In the 7th grade, I would have expressed ideas like, "Hate is a bug," and, "Most people are delusional," as earnest, approval seeking stories.

Earnest, approval seeking stories were like the icing on the cake of video games that were mostly interesting because of their innovations in the simulation of virtual worlds. If I had tried to write these ideas down in a blog post like I'm doing right now, I would have framed the whole process as parody in a thousand little ways, and I would have written that way more out of habit than intention.

(FIVE) I like to believe satirical storytelling is the natural state for human expression. The art and science of serious writing is a deeply iterative process that's shamelessly and deceitfully disguised as a kind of whimsical expression.

In reality, you should, of course, never admit that you've noticed this, but I'm writing this article in a way that sends signals to other adults that I can back stop what I'm saying, all the way, with politics, the law, and maybe even a total war in which the people who are on my side will win, unconditionally, even if, especially if, in fact, the war is, technically speaking, a failure for everyone. How do you like me now? Stay whimsical, my friends!

And so, this morning, I have two new ideas. The first is my design for high heeled platform wedges. That idea simply would not and could not have occurred to me in the seventh grade.

That is, I wanted to be more feminine back then, but I had no appreciation of style and fashion, sigh. I was still getting all my fashion sense from watching cable TV specials about war, and war is a very narrow source of inspiration for thinking about fashion.  Hehe.

(SIX) My other new idea is that Silicon Valley, and maybe the whole world is at an inflection point where we need to decide if we want to build computers in our image or if we want to make some fundamental changes to our design, as humans. I see so many people around Silicon Valley these days projecting dogmatic faith that anything and everything that human beings do is naturally is good, and I think that's dangerous.

(SEVEN) If hate is a part of the source code of human beings, then maybe we should remove that feature when we build machines in our likeness, but right now, the status quo in the increasingly global economic monoculture is to keep that feature, not by choice, but rather by shamelessly and deceitfully burying it under layers of data science and mission statements that are mysteriously consistent with all this the narrow minded loose talk about how empathy and authenticity are truer than whatever else might represent belief in God.  Everything else, including my identity, is now being framed as suspicious.

(BUT) Silicon Valley, and maybe the whole world, for that matter, was never a place that proved willing, or even able, to follow the status quo to its logical ends, and so I remain hopeful for a better future.


[30. Twelth Post By Me]

(November 5, CMO)

Maybe everyone is playing culturally defined character roles and having faith in the idea that the work of being present to other people and aligning one's character with culture is the highest form of truth and authenticity.

Corporate brands, ranging from local businesses to Fortune 500 companies, create and store value by proactively shaping cultural norms.

It's only taboo to say we're all playing characters because that idea could deflate the value of corporate brands on a scale that would reboot the real economy.

Social norms offer men and women substantially different ways to explain away situations where they break their current character role, either to relax or due to physical or mental exhaustion, but that aspect of culture is also taboo to discuss, because it's based on making the assertion that we're all playing characters.

The increasingly global economic monoculture is built on the layers of western style military dominance, the duality of religion and rule of law, and the company defined character roles that became entrenched during the 1960s counter culture, and have, more recently, been reified through successive layers of parody, including 90s grunge and alternative culture, hipsterism, and the new normalism of the present?


[31. Thirteenth Post By Me]

(November 6, CMO)

I seem to have put together the pieces of the puzzle for a male character that's sufficient for persistently holding back the strongly misleading stereotypes that get projected onto me, perhaps, in part, because of the unnatural deviation of my right cheekbone.

I'm inclined to waste no time, and start being this new, unified male character as much as possible, in place of being Suzy, as a way to cope and move forward.

I want to live as a masculine person in a male body, but, I still think, more than ever, that it's worth trying to spin off the Suzy character into being the brand for some decentralized semantic web software, which will be code named WhatLooks.

Suzy was the character concept I started developing boldly and publicly in 2009.  She allowed me to gradually bootstrap my way out of the unwelcome roles I kept getting boxed into by the external influence of culture, and so, for me, Suzy is an expression of a truth that continues to be ignored and suppressed by the consensus of mainstream culture.

In my particular case, a good solution is to build software that gives the truth, that's represented by the Suzy brand, a platform to grow, by facilitating and bootstrapping additional artistry and scientific research.

That truth can also serve as a resource and model for anyone who wants to build their own platform that facilitates understanding and then communicates a truth about their life that is being ignored or suppressed.

Technology can have many positive uses, but the idea of using software to build a stabilizing and incubating platform for amplifying the truth, and nothing but the truth, speaks to why I was inspired to learn computer programming in the first place, and this idea highlights a fundamental strength of the culture of America, and Silicon Valley too, to keep becoming kinder, wiser, and more sustainable, as a culture.

I may continue iterating on this founding story, but I'm inclined to let this story be my primary motivation so that I can finally start focusing on implementing my idea for a decentralized semantic web.


[32. Disclaimer]

(Winter 2014, CMO)

As a final note, please be aware that I've made an extraordinary effort in my public writing, and increasingly, and God willing, if you will, in private discussions, to only talk about the effects of my subtle facial injury within the context of my personal life.

My experience of working in the software industry is that it is, and has been, sufficient to produce deliverables, and I'm really glad to live in a place where that kind of objectivity happens, and is possible, within economic life.

And while there are plenty of conversations I'd like to have about the culture of Silicon Valley workplaces, and so on, there are at least as many potential misunderstandings and controversial discussion points that, in my view, and with respect to me personally, should be discussed, first and foremost, in the context of civic life.


[33. Looking Back]

(2014, CEO)

I'm using New Year's to make a strategic shift in the mysterious project that I've been doing, which has something to do with TheSuzy.com Show.  Aside from that, I don't have a good understanding of what I did, or did not do, this year.  I don't know how to even summarize, and I know so much less still about what might happen next year!

I am, however, feeling more joyful and optimistic than I've ever felt, and I'm very thankful, in general, and in particular, with respect to all the people who have helped me arrive at this wonderful turning point in my life!


[34. Moving Forward]

(2015, CEO)

If a person repeatedly gets the feeling that other people are projecting false and unfairly negative stereotypes and onto them, they should seek out respectful, appropriate, legal, and increasingly public channels to tell the truth about their lived experience.

And if that person happens to have some combination of education, money, skill, talent, and so on which allows them to hide and explain away the negative effects that stereotype based treatment has on their life, it is toxic for them, and for society too, if they knowingly and systematically use these resources to cover up the simple truth about their lives.

When people who have such resources allow themselves to cover up injustices, then all the humans who respond to their deployment of resources become complicit in the process of hiding the whole truth about the mechanisms of unconscious bias, stereotype threat, and institutionalized discrimination.

If you're being unfairly stereotyped, even in a way that seems trivial, petty, and complicated to tell others about, find a respectful, appropriate, and legal way to talk about it, that converges on building a new consensus with regard to the truth about your own life.

And don't forget to be prepared to exercise a lot of patience and emotional strength, for however long it takes.

An extended struggle to live each moment of your life with open, honest, integrity is worth it, more than my former self could have realistically imagined.

[[Season 5: TheSuzy Teaser]]

The following skit is a re-enactment of a writing process that took place way back when in early 2013. (SUZY WAVES A MAGIC WAND AND AUTH APPEARS)

[Auth] Hey, I'm 36 year old male software engineer named Auth, and back when I was 32, I was pretty sure that I could have gotten a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder, but I never bothered to find out.

[mSuzy] Hey Auth, I'm mSuzy.  Why didn't you look into getting a diagnosis?

[Auth] Maybe I'm just socially awkward, because I struggled most of my life with relating to neurotypical people, also known as NTs, but then I recently perfected a process for acting like NT people.  My process is called Rocking Character Traits in Context.  If you act like NT people, then they are easy to relate to, but it's actually quite complicated to imitate what they do.

[mSuzy] Rocking Character Traits in Context sounds awsome!  Tell us more, Auth.

[Auth] I stumbled on my process for imitating NTs when I started cross dressing as a haut and usually blonde diva named Suzy.  Suzy wears full makeup, high heels, a big blonde wig, quality breast forms, and cute outfits that show off her legs and flatter her figure.  This look is easy for any engineer to create because you can shamelessly imitate celebrities.

[mSuzy] Ha ha ha!

[Auth] The first time I went out in public dressed as Suzy, I was very scared.  Other humans used to scare me in general, but when I dressed up as Suzy I started getting an order of magnitude more attention than I was used to getting.  After a while, I realized that most of the attention I was getting was positive.  Most people just wanted to tell me that I looked beautiful, and they did not want anything else from me.

[mSuzy] Wasssup! Auth is at the party now!

[Auth] Over time, I became less afraid to go out as Suzy.  As I became less afraid, I noticed that Suzy was responding to the attention she was getting with strong eye contact and an engaging, authentic smize. This was surprising to me because, as a man, I could never figure out the proper way to make eye contact and smize in a way that other people found engaging.  Suzy was somehow doing exactly that, and she was doing it naturally an unintentionally.

[mSuzy] Fascinating!

[Auth] Suzy also started saying ridiculous things to people in bars, dancing in the center of birthday party crews, and establishing solid beach heads within the fabric of wild bachelorette parties.  I am completely conscious of what Suzy is doing, and she knows all the same stuff that I know, but sometimes she does edgy and socially normal stuff that I would not have any idea how to pull off as a guy.

[mSuzy] Yes, the club scene does seem to favor Suzy, for no reason in particular.

[Auth] Suzy also did a few drag performances at dive bars in California, and I practiced for those performances by lip syncing to four of my favorite divalicious songs, for the duration of entire road trips to Los Angeles.

[mSuzy] Well then.

[Auth] Suzy's fashion sense improved over time with the help of a growing cadre of BFFs. Suzy initially did her shopping on the Internet, and then she went to the thrift store bought a shopping cart full of sexy clothes.  More recently, she started shopping at all the usual chic discount boutiques, and Suzy now has over 50 pairs of high heel shoes to show for all of that hard work.

[mSuzy] I can't argue with that!

[Auth] All of these experiences are examples of what I call Rocking Character Traits in Context.  All character traits are essentially variations on wearing a funky hat.  Clothing only counts as a character trait if it stands out in some way that can serve as a conversation piece, and not all character traits are clothing.  Other examples of traits include hiring a videographer, carrying a cup of fruit to a barbecue at a frat house, wearing all pink, driving to the beach in a red convertible, and getting spanked on your birthday, on stage, in front of an audience.

[mSuzy] Oh my!

[Auth] Character traits always exist in a context.  If that context is looking at yourself in the mirror at home, then the trait won't have much effect.  It is important to rock traits in public settings where you can feel the energy of other people and engage in an iterative process of responding to their energy with your own authentic energy and, therefore, feel how your response affects their energy, and so on.  My hypothesis is that this iterative process of stimulus and response was the driving force that caused Suzy's brain to develop a natural ability to imitate neurotypicals.  New age philosophy fan people may also be happy to know that some changes also seemed to take place in how my beating heart interacts with my brain.

[mSuzy] I see.

[Auth] The last piece of the puzzle of learning to imitate neurotypicals as a man was to transfer Suzy's social learning over to my persona as a guy and then continuing to Rock Character Traits in Context as as a guy.  Some male character traits that I thus rocked as a guy included using flavored toothpicks, wearing sports jersies all the time, grilling meat and vegetables every night for a week, getting really into rock gym climbing, and, of course, wearing outrageous hats at parties.

[mSuzy] No words.

[Auth] Anyway, I'm pretty sure that's the essence of what neurotypicals are doing that people like me often have trouble imitating, and, also, it would be cool if more neurotypicals were more open minded to appreciating and seeing the great beauty in what I still like to call the autistic way of being.

[mSuzy] YAYAYA!

[Auth] For example, one side benefit of acting autistic is that it makes it easier to focus for long periods of time on writing computer software, and writing software is a proxy for doing everything else that you need to do in order to procure food, water, shelter, medical care, and resources to make and share art, because acting neurotypical is one type of artistic activity that you can indulge in, but there are many other types of artistic activity to enjoy as well!

[mSuzy] OMG, I just got an idea.  I'm going to create an amazing structured database about myself and distribute it via a restful API that will be hosted at TheSuzy.com

[[[3:The Reality Virtual Show]]]

Some but not all of these episodes were distributed online in the form of unscripted video prior to the release of of this book.  The versions of the episodes that appear in this book are not necessarily the same as the versions that were previously distributed.

[[Episode 0]]

[CMO] Hi, my name is Norman.  I'm popularizing the idea of playing characters in real life.  The reason I play characters is because I have a lot of autistic traits, and I have a facial injury.  The right side of my cheekbone is bashed in a little bit.  I was playing hide and seek in college and this kid's forehead ran into me by accident, and the doctors weren't able to pull it all the way out, so it's slightly sunken down, and my theory is that people view that as a negative facial expression.  And I'm saying that along the lines of a microexpression.

[CTO] So, when I say autistic traits, what I mean is more pauses and more of a flat affect, like this.  When people are like, "Why don't you just be your true authentic self," the simple answer is I actually do this a lot of the time, like, more than half the time.  This would be my true authentic self.  If I get really tired, or if I'm relaxed and enjoying life, I'm gonna be like this.

[CMO] This character, you can see it's on a dial.  I can turn it up more or I can keep it only half volume.  And it still has a lot of the same elements as;

[CTO] My true authentic self, and I'm obviously always going to step over to the right side when I drop all the way into this.

[CMO] But in order to be functional, the best way to put it is that if I don't turn this on and smile all the time, people think I'm throwing shade or mean mugging them for no reason, and it really makes me sad when I can tell people have that perception, and the way this works is you can't tell someone, "Oh I think you misread my emotions, because of my facial injury."  It's like, the only way forward is to turn this on a little bit, and then they're like, "Mmm, maybe I misread his emotions.  He seems like a nice guy."

[CTO] If I do this, religiously, which I would be fine doing, I, wish there was some country I could travel to, or planet perhaps, where nobody saw this in a negative way.

[CMO] And we get into this whole debate about whether people view it negatively.  Everyone's like, "We don't view it negatively!  We think you're great just the way you are!"

[CTO] But that's not my experience.  As much as people say that, I miss out on a lot of opportunities if I stay within this range.

[CMO] I also miss out on opportunities if I speak my truth, which is that if I turn this on, I would call this playing a character.  It feels like I'm breaking out into song for no reason, in the middle of an SAT math test.  It's very contrived, and I don't have a problem with that.  It's similar to speaking a foreign language, and there's a lot of beauty and joy that comes from learning this other culture.  I feel like I'm participating in a different culture by turning on this character.

[CTO] And this is my culture, which is good, and, in some ways I'm stumbling into having a conversation about white male privilege and the atrocities of people who looked like me throughout history, and particularly the last few hundred years of history, and that's part of why this is a difficult conversation and a difficult truth to tell that, like, this is how I am, and I'm not ok with the opportunities I have in life, if I'm committed to being in this mode most of the time.

[CMO] Or more importantly, if I'm committed to never admitting this feels contrived and that this is like speaking a foreign language, or breaking out into song.

[CEO] And I want to bring up my other character, Suzy, who is gonna be standing on the left hand side here.  This is the character I used to build a lot of my social awareness.  When I was younger;

[CTO] In high school, I was more like this, and I got the facial injury when I was 20 years old, and without the injury, I might be a lot more of a typical software engineer who is very comfortable and gets through things by doing a lot of this quiet confidence act where I'm like, "Yeah I don't have anything to prove, I'm enjoying my life and I want to make things better for other people.  That's what I'm committed to doing."  That would be a lot easier for me to pull off if I had this more symmetrical face, but because I have this thing going on; (POINTS AT FACE)

[CMO] That was interesting.  I was turning up the character a little bit when I was in that mode, imagining what I would be like as a person who never had this facial injury, and I do think there's a much wider gray area, and I'm like;

[CTO] Autistic, big pun that I'm wearing a gray shirt and talking about gray area;

[CMO] My brain works that way and that's part of what makes me different, but the facial injury is the higher order bit that's forcing me to make a decision to be like, I'm gonna turn this on, and if you look really carefully;

[CTO] So if I relax into this, there's no action in the facial muscles.

[CMO] And when I turn this on it's really subtle.  I'm gonna turn it on and off several times.  (ACTIVATES SMIZE, DEACTIVATES SMIZE) It's very subtle.  This is microexpression territory, but when I'm out in public, the difference, which it's really founded on, it's queued by doing that thing where I'm razing both of these muscles.  It's very subtle. The more subtlety, the more effective it is because we live in this culture where when a stranger encounters me, they have to believe this is my true authentic self, otherwise, I'm not gonna get that positive response.

(CONDUCTOR) If I try to be like; It's actually kind of hard to imitate a guy whose trying to play a character, but it's like this, "This is a little more like what I was doing in the past, and it seems kinda fake." (DONE)  This is just a more refined version of that, and it's still kind of fake and a lot of people are gonna call me on it, but I can power through those objections because a lot of people are intrigued by this and, in fact, I can play all the angles.  One of the angles is I have a unique appearance. There is this lack of symmetry and people like that, and as long as they get an overall perception that I'm a happy person who gives more than he takes from the world, and when I do the little smile, and I do this thing, it's clearly creating that perception in a majority of people, and I can get a room to come to a consensus that I'm a good person to have around.

[CTO] And as much as people want to tell me the same thing is possible from this, it's not.  It's not even close.  I see this over and over again, if I try to go to any social event, even a professional event that's got a bunch of other engineers, and I stay in this; Like, a music concert or an art show opening or a networking thing that is not just engineers, you can see me turning on a character again.  That speaks a little bit to how natural the character process is.  My whole point is that it's not fake to play a character.  What is fake is to have this culture where we insist on never analyzing the process, because for someone like me it took a tremendous amount of work.

[CEO] I had to create the Suzy character and present myself in this way.  I don't know what it is about this. Ah, this is where we can get very analytical and talk about what exactly am I doing in this character;

[CMO] That's different from this character.  They're very similar.  Clearly this character is built on the;

[CEO] Foundation of playing this character.  There's 80% neural sharing between the two, and it's important to understand that this came first.  This is what I went out and was doing in social environments and people were like, "You're so much fun, let me talk to you for a while."

[CTO] As opposed to this, where I do not get that response.  It's like pulling teeth to keep people in a conversation with me, and I don't get upset at other people.  I'm just stating the fact that when I do this at any kind of social event, it's very difficult to have meaningful conversation with anybody because people are always exiting the conversation, and everyone knows this;

[CMO] The harder you try to keep people in a conversation, the worse it's gonna get.  You have to accept your level of acceptance and hope for the best, and the best when I'm doing this is way better than;

[CTO] When I'm doing this, the best is (BREATH) not very good.  The best I could hope for is an engineering interview where they will hire me to write code for them so they can make money and act like that is a wonderful thing and that I'm contributing to their wonderful thing.

[CMO] But I wanna do wonderful things.  I don't want to be this cog in the machinery that's helping other people do wonderful things, that's not good enough.  That does not get over the bar of dignity and the fundamental respect that all people deserve.

[CTO] And that's a big reason why I'm doing this.  I keep coming back to that phrase.  Dignity and the fundamental respect that all people deserve.  We've got to get real about the discrepancy between the most natural outcomes of the free market and that higher ideal where we appreciate all people for they're humanity, and people can appreciate me even when I'm doing this all the time, and part of why it's difficult for me to go into the world and be like, "Hey this is how I am, and all this other stuff I do is more of a character," that's hard to do because we have a lot of economic injustice, and there's a lot of social injustice that may or may not be related to economic injustice.  That's the bigger mission of why I want to have this conversation.

[CMO] But in order to do that, sure, I can create a video, but in order to function, I have to do this. I can't be a healthy person, I can't grow, and I certainly can't learn from other people unless I do this thing that makes other people a lot more comfortable sharing their ideas and collaborating with me.

[CEO] And the Suzy character is something I want to maintain, but I also don't like the idea of doing this as much out in public anymore even though it's still my strongest suit, like, if I'm struggling in a social situation, I'm gonna do this.

[CMO] Although, the whole thing about privilege; If I'm in a dangerous situation, I actually find a lot of security in this, and that's interesting.

[CEO] There's a lot of places in the world where this character is not going to be as safe;

[CMO] As this character, and I'm like, "What's up with that?"  Why does the world care?  It shouldn't be that way, but the world is a harsh place, and so I have stability in some places like this, but then;

[CEO] Here in the bay area, in almost any social context, I am more stable here, but there's less long term integrity to this because I don't want to do this my whole life.  This isn't nearly as accurate of a reflection of who I am.

[CMO] As this is.  This is a much simpler variation on the underlying masculine.  I have a male body, that I was born in, and I also feel is a fit for who I am.  This is a lot more of a simpler character to play, and that's a good rule of thumb for characters. A character should be as simple as possible, at least, in the context that I'm playing characters.  Maybe one day;

[CTO] There will be this world where I can be like this all the time, and it won't matter at all, and that would be a good thing because even though the bandwidth of my communication is slower, I'm probably more effective at writing code and also writing ideas in prose, but in this emerging format of structured data where you create objects and links, it's a mix between writing and coding (TRAIN HORN) and, my heart is pounding in time with this train that's coming by. It's been happening this whole video, it's a realization that I might release this video.  It's driving me deeper into the frame, and when I say frame, I mean a set of assumptions.

[CMO] And I'm gonna switch up here because I'm trying to communicate this idea.  It's easier for me to keep the flow going when I turn this on, and my heart is pounding even more when I turn this on because a lot of what the character process does is, it integrates these body language traits and the connection to the semantic meaning of that within our culture.  It aligns all that with the entire physiology.  The entire body, including the heart rate.  Who knows what else.  In yoga they talk about energies.  I can feel tingling in my fingers as well.  That stuff is what makes this character better than a fake slap stick character that everyone is gonna respond to like, "Dude just be yourself."

It's harder to do this, and one of the reasons why is because my heart rate is aligned with what I'm doing.  I got a little big with, "My HEART rate is aligned with what I'm doing!"  That stuff is, those are signs the character lacks a certain polish.  This is a very new character.  I only put the pieces of the puzzle together two days ago, although when you hit upon a character pattern that is on the right side cultural appropriation, it develops very quickly.  It goes straight down into the physiology.  You can feel it in your heart rate like, "Oh, I'm doing something that's probably going to keep growing," like a plant that's in good soil, good rain, good sunshine.  It's going to grow.


[[Episode 1]]

[CEO] Hey everyone, and welcome to the first episode of TheSuzy.Com Reality Virtual Show.  Joining me today are my guests, to my right is Norman.

[CMO] Hi, my name is Norman, and thank you for inviting me to join you on the show today, Suzy.

[CEO] And to my left, Norm.

[CTO] Hi, I'm Norm.  I'm like normcore without the core.

[CEO] You practiced that line didn't you?  But the rest of this show is not rehearsed, and I wanna apologize in advance if this show begins a little slowly because I have very little experience doing unscripted video.  The way I'm gonna learn is by doing this show once a week.  I like the idea of doing it on a Sunday in the manner of the Sunday morning political talk shows.  It's inevitable that this will be a very intellectual format.  Why don't you add to that Norman?

[CMO] Yes, this is my first time performing dressed as a woman, even though I identify as a male character.  Suzy is a female, and Norm also identifies as a male character.

[CTO] I don't care about gender.  That might be an important distinction between you and me.

[CEO] Tell me more about that.  I want to get back to your comments, Norman, but tell me more.  What do you mean by that?

[CTO] Well, this is unscripted.  We didn't plan to talk about this.  I'm not going to identify as anything other than the true authentic self of this body.

[CEO] That was another practiced line.  I don't want you to use the practiced lines anymore.  We need to make an almost religious effort to go unscripted, at least for this first handful of videos, so that we understand the format, and then once we get better at it, we can develop some talking points.  Back to you Norman.

[CMO] I don't see anything wrong with Norm using some talking points from the beginning.  It's a good way to make him engaging.

[CTO] Uh, (HANDS OUT WIDE) we're gonna have some status issues in the unscripted format.  That is clear to me right now.  I'm using big body language here to address that.

[CEO] And this is what happened, this was almost 18 months ago, when we started doing video.  I should give you some background.  I started writing a show called TheSuzy.com Show to talk about why I cross dress, and it was an exploratory process.  I wanted to get to the bottom of why I did this.  I just started going out for fun, and I found that people treated me differently, and I wanted to understand more about what that all meant.

[CMO] People treated you in a way that was really enjoyable for you.  More importantly, you were able to learn more about culture and other people.  You were able to practice empathy more effectively than you ever could without dressing up, and that's the essential question we need to get to the bottom of.

[CEO] That phrase, get to the bottom of.  Why do we use that phrase?  I'm sensitive about this.  We talked about this before the show.

[CTO] What do you mean by you're sensitive?  This seems like a status play to me.  I don't want you to do this thing where you go lower status than us as a way to assert your leadership.  You need to lead directly if you're gonna be the leader, Suzy.

[CEO] Thank you for your candor, and I agree, this is my show to lead.  I stand in the center, and I do the introductions.  We have a plan, long term, that Norman is going to take over and dress as a male, but for the next six months, I wanna do the show where I'm the leader.  And when I say take over;

[CMO] The idea that we've discussed. Our discussions in private are very interesting.  There's a part of me that wishes we had it all on video, although that would not be appropriate.  We all need privacy, and when the three of us start talking about what we want to do with the rest of our life, everything is on the table, and privacy is important, both to respect ourselves and to respect other people and information that we have about other people that is not ours to share, and;

[CTO] Cultural appropriation, is the real issue.  The opportunity of playing multiple characters is; (PAUSE)

[CEO] Let me jump in.  I don't like you to do these long pauses.  In our private conversation we talked about whether a long pause represents a problem, and what we came to is that Norm represents our true authentic self, so he's gonna have some thoughts that are not always appropriate to share in public.  One of the advantages of playing a character like Suzy or Norman is there's a built in filter.  We don't know how this stuff works.

[CMO] But we imagine.  I'm the newest character, so it's fresher for me to talk about this.  We theorize there's a pattern of neural growth in the mind, and that pattern queues up all the body language we're doing.  And built on top of that body language are conceptual patterns, multiple word phrases that combine into;

[CEO] An idiom.  And then idioms combine into stories.  Call them story patterns.

[CTO] Yeah, so I'm more likely to have pauses than them, and those pauses often reflect the way my mind works, naturally, but the pauses, on occasion; Thoughts that are on the wrong side of cultural appropriation, where I have a frustration about my life that I have dealt with by identifying with the experience of people whose lives are different from me.  This is the way people deal with adversity, we compare our story with others, and we don't always do that in fair way.

[CEO] Inside our own mind, we all have a responsibility to push ourselves to compare our lives to others in a fair way, when we speak in public, which is what we're doing in this video, in the most formal way.  This is a public video that's on the record.  It's hard to say I didn't make this video.  Writing is a little bit more vague, but a video;

[CMO] A video is the ultimate stamp of authenticity in this era.  It would be interested to see what we could do to frame ourselves as saying something we didn't say.  I would like to learn how to do that in the manner of computer hackers learning how to infiltrate systems so they can protect their computer against those attack vectors.

[CEO] Yeah, we're getting onto the military stuff.  We want to speak about the future of military technology.  That's something Norman is very interested in; it's also an interest of Norm.  I question whether it was ever an interest of mine.  I talk about it with them because they bring it up.

[CTO] At the risk of just dropping the previous topic, we should go ahead and talk about the military.  It's a meaningful transition from the discussion about cultural appropriation in private and in public.

[CEO] I had a dream last night, it involved a white male speaking in a certain accent that I'm not going to imitate.  This is one of those things I want to keep private.  It was in my dream and the way I'm phrasing this, I don't think anyone would ever guess what I'm getting at here.

[CMO] And that's fine.  It can become a point of discussion.  We want, long term, to have people add substantive feedback to the ideas we talk about, and I hope, in some cases, that feedback will be in the form of unscripted video which can refer to;

[CEO] Current news stories as a way of time stamping when the video was created.  But back to the dream, since you're the root of the body, why don't you tell this?

[CTO] The guy speaking in an unnamed accent was carrying a Greek column.  It had stone mason aspects to it, and we concluded that, why don't you deliver the punch line?

[CEO] I forget what it is. Norman?

[CMO] I don't remember either.  Let me see, it's the idea that;

[CEO] We're blocking.  What are we gonna do?  This is the fear of unscripted video is that some of the most important ideas we want to share will vanish, and this might be an essential feature of how the mind works.  There is a reason, and we're gonna remember, and as soon as we do we're gonna get back to it.

[CTO] This point about how the mind works, when I go to a social event, and I have that thing happen where there's a profound thought I've spent a lot of time thinking about and because it's so central, all of the stuff I've thought about is very decentralized around it, and so those thoughts are firing as neurons and I can't bring it back to the central thought, certainly not without a long pause.

[CEO] And we're making a big effort not to have an awkward 30 second pause here in the video, although we have been thinking about taking breaks at least every 20 minutes and doing no more than an hour long episode, so that could be an opportunity to go back and figure out what the point was about the dream with the stone mason carrying the column.

[CMO] So we're calling the person a stonemason now?  That's a code for what it really is.

[CEO] Fair enough.  That's the nature of dreams.  They apply labels to things that protect us from the underlying meaning.  That might be a way to think about what these characters do. They provide meaningful facades that don't involve anything untrue, but it allows us to talk about things in a way that ensures we'll always be on the right side of cultural appropriation.

[CTO] Why did you turn to me.  I have nothing to say at this moment.  I gonna pause and try to remember the thought.

[CEO] It's not.  We're pretty far away from it.  The point we wanted to make is that I am much better at absorbing these pauses and then changing the subject quickly without seeming too out of character, if you will.  I can change subjects and talk about; I can even talk about the weather.  I'm not that good of a conversationalist, but the visuals that I have make it easier for me to convince other people that I have a story to tell and that I'm interested in listening to their story.  I just sit there and it seems that people feel I'm interested in their story.

[CMO] One of the experiments we haven't done; This will be another thing we can do with the unscripted format is talk about some of the social experiences we have throughout the week.  So I have not been out in public dressed this way, but using this character pattern.  This is more or less how I act around people.  It takes a little more effort to do this character if I get tired or if I'm among close friends and I feel very relaxed and I'm not having my status challenged constantly;

[CTO] I will drop into this character.  It's not that I care about having my status challenged.  I'll sit there and let people do the thing where their like, "Oh no worries, it's ok, just calm down, it's a party."  You can say stuff like that to me and I'll just sit there and allow you to say it.  I won't contradict you, I won't challenge you, but if it becomes a pattern and if it goes on and on and people are starting to avoid being seen next to me because everyone is treating me that way.

[CEO] That's where this pattern become helpful, I can enter a conversation and keep the flow going, and add value, so people will stay in the conversation, so I won't have to be standing alone.

[CTO] Because let's be very clear, if I don't join conversations, I will be standing alone, and the longer I stand alone, the fewer people there are.

[CEO] It's ironic hearing you guys say that when you're dressed this way because one of the main advantages of going out like this is that if I'm standing alone, people come to me.  I can stand there like this, and people will just come up and talk to me so I don't ever have to join conversations.  It's almost a rule.  If I'm out of people to talk to, I just stand in the corner and people come to me, and then I play off of their interest in me, and I can usually get that going like a storm that lasts for the whole party, where everyone will see me as the center of attention.  I;

[CMO] We don't want to overstate that, even if it's true, this is one of the things I have learned, more than Suzy, so when Suzy's in the moment she is sometimes the center of attention, and she knows to downplay it, and try to give some of that attention to others.  What I often do is talk way too long about Suzy's adventures;

[CEO] And I'm going to save you from yourself by taking back over the mike.  I want to revisit this dream that we had.  What I'll do is go back one step.  We had a dream before that, also last night, about being a nerd in our college years.  I would even say teenage years.  The dream was a little ambiguous whether it was high school or college, and there was a party, and I vividly said to someone I don't want to join the party because I want to have an intellectual discussion with a couple friends, and;

[CTO] So, the point of dreams, in most cases, for us, is to let go of ideas that no longer serve us like we do in yoga class.  This dream was letting go of the idea that I wanted to join that intellectual discussion.  The reality is I didn't want to go get treated badly and stand alone in the corner with the normal people, so I told the lie, it was a lie, that I preferred the intellectual discussion.  That was a full on lie that I told many times, and I didn't realize how deeply rooted that lie was for me until I had this dream and released the energy associated with that.

[CEO] Aren't you very new age. Talking about energies and letting go of ideas that no longer serve us.  I agree completely, and one of the advantages of playing this character is that I forget that I ever told that lie.  I don't have to tell that lie when I dress like this and go to parties.  I really do very well in social environments here in Silicon Valley, and yet, deeply rooted in my subconscious was that belief.

[CMO] And this is especially powerful for me because the reality is, when we go to parties, I have to do the talking, because if Norm does the talking we will be standing alone in the corner, and we can just stand alone for the entire party and then go home at the end, but in order to talk to people I have to get in the game, and for me to do that effectively I have to let go of that attachment.

[CEO] There's a little southern accent there.

[CMO] Suzy please don't;

[CEO] Ok, what happened there, is I called out his southern accent while standing in his space which is not something I want to do, and then I jumped over here to speak but he jumped into my space, so we can call it even.

[CMO] Yes, we can call it even.  The point is I have to let go of that attachment in order to be flowing at parties and not get hung up on this question of, "Am I a nerd who has to tell the lie that I'd rather be in an intellectual discussion."

[CTO] And you guys have the southern accent, that's not my domain.  I don't do accents.

[CEO] I'm not sure I agree with that.  I will let you say that in a public video, but in private I'm going to challenge you on that.

[CMO] This is the challenge of unscripted video.  Let's address what Norm just said.  He said, "I don't do accents," and the reality is he does do accents but we've chosen not to do that on unscripted video.  This is a powerful line in the sand.  It applies to southern accents and also any other foreign accent.  It's one of a dozen rules that we have, that help ensure that we stay on the right side of cultural appropriation.

[CEO] It's the idea that when you're in the character, you can't miss.  We can't say something that's disrespectful to ourselves or other people.

[CTO] And I agree completely.  If I start doing accents.  (ROBOTIC) Any accent other than this accent. (DONE)  That's the famous speech synthesizer.  Well, it was made famous by REDACTED.

[CEO] Norm, you were imitating me as well just there.

[CTO] Yes, I was, and it's funny, I feel that it's ok for me to imitate you guys because you imitate me all the time.  Every time you pause, you're essentially imitating me.

[CEO] That's true.  Every time I run out of things to say, I become Norm, and when I think of something to say, I jump back into playing the Suzy character, and that's why we say Norm is the root of our personality.

[CMO] And that is why we, Suzy and I, need to take responsibility for any symbolic gestures, other than the speech synthesizer.

[CTO] I don't even know if the speech synthesizer is respectful.

[CEO] I think it is.  I will go on the record and say it's respectful for you to do the speech synthesizer.  REDACTED owned that.

[CMO] Whoa.  We're talking about cultural appropriation here and you just spoke on behalf of REDACTED.  How do you do that.  Explain.  I challenge you on that, Suzy.

[CEO] Thank you for challenging me.  I don't know how to put it, it's the power of physics.  The idea of being someone who understands how the universe works, and being a writer and author and using that speech synthesizer as a tool for communication on top of that layer.  It's very clear the speech synthesizer in no way reflects the reality of REDACTED's life.  Their life was well represented by their writing, and so the speech synthesizer is fair game for parody.

[CTO] I agree with that.  I want to be very open to revisiting that statement.  But I feel (ROBOTIC) very good about that. (DONE)

[CEO] One of the things we don't talk about very often is that Norm often laughs, and we want to get as much of that on the show as possible.  Those laughs are just as authentic as a long pause, that's cause because of how our mind works.

[CMO] Or even because Norm has a thought that he knows is not safe to say in public, and he's pausing to think about it.

[CEO] But I want to be very clear, that's not the main reason why Norm pauses.

[CTO] Enough.  You guys have made your point.  Let's go back to the nerd stereotype.  This was the big idea from the first dream.  We let go of the attachment to the nerd stereotype.  I'm no longer worried about people projecting it onto me.  I'm no longer gonna tell that lie.  If I'm standing alone in the corner and I choose to have an intellectual conversation, I'll be honest, I would have preferred to keep socializing at the party because I can have intellectual conversations with people all day, everyday, but it's rare that I have the chance to meet new people and feel empathy and express emotions at a party.  I take those opportunities as special.

[CEO] Especially because it's a lot of work to go out to parties, so it's a shame to make all that effort to go out and feel there's no opportunity to connect with people and feel empathy and share stories.

[CMO] So what's the connection to the military and the stonemason carrying a column?

[CEO] We're still blocking on that one.  That was a very big dream that I wanted to be the basis of this broadcast, so we're going to take a break, remember what the point was, and continue in just a moment.

(BREAK)

[CEO] And we're back with the second part of our first episode.  The big idea we had in the second dream was this question of why do people who work for a living who and make less than the median income vote Republican, which is seen as the party that protects business interests.  We, I'm worrying about whether I'm speaking loud enough, but I'm gonna commit to the unscripted format.  We're not gonna redo that.

[CMO] Let me say that again. Typically people say working class or even blue collar, but Suzy is a big fan of this phrase, "People who work for a living who make less than the median income."  The question is, why do working class men vote Republican.  They should not.  They should be voting Democrat so they can get more government services and so we can raise taxes on the wealthy people who are getting a disproportionate share of the work that these men do.

[CEO] But the dream we had with the stone mason carrying the Greek column gave us the idea that maybe the reason people who work for a living vote Republican is because they know without American exceptionalism;

[CTO] Stay calm, Suzy, and let me handle it!  That was not script, without American exceptionalism, people who work for a living are going to be in the situation of REDACTED factory workers, for lack of a better example, in China.

[CEO] You might be better at politics than I thought.  You have trouble working the room at parties, but when you have the microphone all to yourself I find you to be quite articulate.

[CTO] I would not have expected that, but I enjoy talking about this stuff.  American exceptionalism is the reason our GDP is as high as it is, and if it's not, unless you're a software engineer or some other high demand position, the average American worker is going to be like the average Chinese worker in 10 years unless we maintain American exceptionalism.

[CMO] And that's not going to happen because the world is moving the other way.  Technology will automate a lot of these jobs and more importantly, it's going to change the military paradigm.  That brings us full circle to what we were saying at the beginning about how we wanted to talk about the military.  We believe, and this is totally a layman's opinion, not based on insider knowledge and not well researched, but we believe we're entering a new military paradigm.  Why don't you tell us about that, Suzy?

[CEO] In the new military paradigm, drones will become the dominant force in global assertion of power, beyond politics.  That's how I would like to put it.

[CTO] The idea is, say you have an oil rig in the middle of the ocean, and a battleship approaches to take it out.  The question is, can you launch a cloud of drones off the oil rig and take out the battleship before it takes out the rig, and this is an easy calculation because in this day and age you don't need any people on the oil rig.

[CEO] Or the battleship for that matter, although the ship represents the old military paradigm. The new paradigm is one that does not involve nearly as many people.

[CMO] Although it's very important, when we dig into how do you assert military dominance with drones, is that the drones are essentially working under under cover.  The battleship example is safe for discussion because we can imagine this happening in international waters between corporations, for all we care, so it's not clear if it's terrorism, or what it is.  The question is, can the drones infiltrate the battleship, find the weaknesses, and fire various ordinance.

[CEO] Can we not use the term ordinance?  It makes it sounds like you know more about this than you really do.

[CMO] Absolutely.  Fire various weapons into the battleship and any exposed place where humans are involved. The drones will systematically try to take out the humans.  Even though you might not need as many people to operate the battleship, any people who are there as a fail safe mechanism for the computers, or the satellite uplink going bad, the drones are gonna target them relentlessly, so it's actually a front line position now to be an operator.

[CEO] And I want to announce that we have trains going by here, which is appropriate, talking about battleships and drones, and what not.  Imagine, we're here in Berkeley, California by the Oakland ports, just imagine if you had a few shipping containers of weaponized drones come in, somehow get onto one of these trains, and now they're going into the interior.  Who knows what could happen.

[CTO] That's the bigger question about the drone paradigm.  What happens when it reaches land?  This question is very relevant because Putin's Russia has tested whether you can cross, or disrespect, internationally recognized boundaries through proxy soldiers.  Drones are gonna always be proxy soldiers.  Half of the art is making it really unclear who is operating the drones and creating these multi-step scenarios where outcomes are shifted in a probabilistic way that you can never tie back to the shadow elite actors who are playing around with probabilities, which in turn, reflects the rest of this technology paradigm.

[CEO] And I'll add, the idea is you look at what computer scientists are doing in social media and web search.  They are doing a lot of probabilistic analysis about the behavior of people and trying to influence which kind of products people buy and even how they live their life.  There's questions about can we improve public health outcomes through the design of social software.  These are positive questions to ask, but that same style of thought could be applied to the use of drones and targeted violence.  We might call it terrorism here in the United States. We like to call that terrorism, but when it's happening in a former Soviet republic it's a little less clear what we should call it.

[CMO] Especially when more and more members of the international community are not sure whether their best interests are served by fighting a global war on terror.

[CEO] That was a big statement.  I'm not sure, there was a shift in the tone here when you say that.

[CMO] This leads back to, we had a conflict in private, debating, are we, personally, always going to be on the side of the United States of America, and the answer is yes, because we were born here and we are legally obligated to have allegiance to America.  We said the pledge of allegiance everyday in school for years.

[CEO] So that's a simple answer, yes, we are.  As a Silicon Valley engineer, we are an American citizen who lives underneath the umbrella of American power structures who in turn;

[CTO] Live underneath the umbrella of God.  Or whatever serves as God these days, and that is where we can have a more interesting debate.  How ironic is that?

[CEO] It is ironic.  There's no question that our allegiance is to the United States, and to the rule of law in this land but there is a question about, take the people who run this country, the people who really have the last word on the assertion of rule of law, both at home and abroad. What are they allegiant too?  What is bigger than them?  Is it God?  Is it a Christian God?  Is it some other kind of God?  Is it a mashup of all of the world's religions?  Is it the United Nations?  Or is it something they make up as they go?

[CMO] I don't believe that.  America's leaders don't make it up as they go.  We always elect leaders based on their religion, for lack of a better word.  Religion is a necessary component of the political process.  America has, primarily, a Christian tradition, and I'll leave it at that.  I don't think anyone's going to argue with that, and that tradition, in practice, has been as tolerant as anywhere else of other religions.

[CEO] That's a strong statement I don't necessarily agree with.  We have to make a weaker statement.  Historically, America had, traditionally, a majority of Christian people in the circles of power, and this has been a country with a history of tolerance and a value system that seeks to increase tolerance, but we don't always do it well.  That would be my statement.

[CTO] So you're the spokesperson for America.  Suzy the spokesperson for America! Is that how it works now?

[CEO] You're looking pretty spokespersony yourself, Norm.  Why don't you see if you can say it better than me?  I'm happy to share this, sort of, being the token American person in the meeting whose gonna speak on behalf of my country.

[CTO] I don't like the way you used the word token.  I really don't like that.  Try again.

[CEO] Yes, I should not have described myself as the token spokesperson for my country, and I'm smiling because I smile all the time in this character, but I don't like that I said that.  What I mean is I am playing a character, and the symbolism is intentionally based on knowledge I have of the history of America, and there's a train going by as if to question my authenticity.

[CMO] This goes back to that idea where we're not sure if we're speaking loudly enough into the camera.  Why don't you say the apology again, louder?  The train was just reminding you to be louder.

[CEO] I'm sorry for saying that I'm the token spokesperson for my country.  That's the best way to describe what I'm doing here as Suzy.  There's a lot of Americans who would not view me as their spokesperson, and they would certainly not view me as a token.  I don't even know what that means.

[CTO] I agree.  We don't know what that means, and that's why it's probably not the right thing to say.  As a character, you need to use meanings in a clear way.  In the handful of cases where you use intentional ambiguity, where words can mean multiple things, you need to have an understanding in your mind what those multiple things are, and make sure all of those things are covered.

[CMO] And that is not something you can do in your head.  You have to do that at the subconscious level, and that's what we try to accomplish through creating a character.  A character is capable of doing thousands of body language and microexpression traits and then stacking language patterns and idioms on top of that, and we continually iterate the characters so the stuff they say is always gonna be on the right side of cultural appropriation, even in cases where something we say or do with our body language has more than one possible meaning.

[CEO] I want to point out that body language is inherently ambiguous.  Almost any body language trait can be interpreted in multiple ways.  Our favorite is the phrase, "No worries."  One way to look at that is you're unfairly projecting anxiety onto the other person.  You're acting like they were worried when maybe they weren't, so that might be unfair, but you can also argue, "Oh I wasn't talking about them."  I was just saying I'm not worried.  I was talking about myself.

[CMO] I'm sorry, I just said that for you.

[CEO] Yes, please don't put words in my mouth like that, Norman, but I would have said the same thing.  When I say no worries, I may be speaking about myself, although you seem a lot more comfortable than I do with saying that, because I go out of my way not to play that card.  I view that as a card where you say no worries to someone and then act like it was a statement about yourself.  Let's face it, it puts the other person in a one down position.

[CMO] Right, but people say, we can prove this very easily with hidden cameras, which we don't use, but we don't need to because this is so obvious.  People say no worries to me like five times more frequently than they say it to you, Suzy, so one of the best ways for me to level the;

[CEO] The playing field?

[CMO] Yeah, one of the best ways for me to level the playing field is to do it back, and say, "Yeah, no worries."  That helps me come up out of the one down position and continue the conversation at a place of equal status.

[CEO] What is this status thing that you speak of?  I don't even know what you could possibly mean by that!

[CTO] Now that is a lie, Suzy.  You just told a lie.

[CEO] Everyone knows it was a lie because I made a cute face.

[CTO] Ok. I have no problem talking about status.  I'm using it in the sense that an author named REDACTED uses it in a book called REDACTED.  We're not talking about flying first class in an airplane.  That's where you pay money and get treated with an explicitly higher level of service.  Some people use the word status to talk about the higher level of service.  I'm talking about what happens between any two people in the moment, with no other extrinsic value being traded.

[CEO] The best example is you meet a stranger, you've never seen this person before and maybe there's a reason to strike up a conversation.  There's some fascinating thing that you say, "Hey, what do you make of that?"  And they other person's like, "No worries, I'm sure it's fine."

[CMO] Can you stop imitating me when you say no worries;

[CEO] I'm sorry, no worries, Norman.  I just think you're so good at saying it.

[CMO] Fine, you're doing this well.

[CEO] That was a weak, come back Norman.  I'm playing a little big higher status than Norman right now.  Let's see how he handles it.

[CMO] The point I think you're making is if you say no worries to the stranger that way, their position is tenuous.  They may not be sure if you respect them at that moment, so they may have to test you to find out if you view them as an equal who has the same opportunity to make something of themselves in the future.

[CEO] I like what you said.  That was a good comeback.  You supported my statement and made yourself appear capable and knowledgeable.  Well done, Norman.

[CMO] Thank you, Suzy, and you are the host of the show, after all.

[CEO] Yes, I am.  Norm, why don't you add to this?

[CTO] Thank you for including me, Suzy.  I would have become angry and attacked your status.

[CEO] Norm, are you imitating me?

[CTO] I was smiling uncontrollably, and that happens to have a lot in common with your smile, Suzy.  Maybe that's one of the reasons you are a strong leader.

[CEO] I will take your words at face value, please continue.

[CTO] The idea was, if you treat someone as lower status, if you run into someone and something interesting happens and you tell them not to worry about it with no context, and there's no reason why they should be worried, that's rude.  It's rude to a level that might even imply you don't view them as a first class citizen.  It's inherent, if you're going around telling someone else not to worry then you must think you're a first class citizen who has equal opportunity to do whatever you want.

[CEO] I question that.  The main reason people do that, like Norman over here, is because they're not quite sure they're a first class citizen.  Maybe a lot of people are telling them not to worry, and they're feeling insecure (LOOKS AT NORMAN), if I may, and so they say no worries more often.

[CMO] It's like a war of no worries.  Everyone is telling each other not to worry, and the more I say no worries to you, the more you're gonna say it back to me, and this escalates until one of us does something different and makes it unambiguous that we are in fact tussling for status.

[CEO] I'm glad you used the word tussling because in almost every case, that's the right word, and introducing the word tussle makes it a lot more appropriate to have a conversation about status.  We're not talking about war.  We're not even joking about war.  We're talking about a well intentioned, friendly, tussle for status, kind of like when people give each other a hard time.  The assumption, when people are doing that, is it is out of empathy and good intention to understand the other person better so you can calibrate your conversational topics to help them help you and create a positive cycle.  A vital cycle.

[CTO] Suzy has a lot of interesting language choices.  She likes to say, "people who work for a living," instead of working class.  She also likes to say vital cycle instead of virtuous cycle because virtue implies a masculine person, and that's a reasonable point to base your language on.

[CEO] And I would call that a memorized line.  It's a habit I've gotten into, and it makes me proud to have these habits.

[CMO] It makes Suzy proud to have habits like saying vital cycle instead of virtuous cycle.  It doesn't mean that she expects other people not to use that term.  It's ambiguous again.  (SOUTHERN) If I say giving each other a hard time is a virtuous cycle that helps us have empathy for each other, Suzy's not going to judge me negatively.  She's not going to give me a hard time back just because I used the term virtue.

[CEO] Or because you speak in a southern accent.

[CMO] Right, but, I'm inspired to imitate Suzy's pattern and have a bias towards using the phrase vital cycle.  I enjoyed learning that trait from Suzy, and symmetrically filtering the alternative trait of using the term virtue.

[CEO] I wanna, since we're talking about status, I wanna bring up this point about us having a southern accent; That we do exactly what you just said.  We filter it and have symmetric alternatives for expressing the same emotions we would normally express through some kind of southern inflection.

[CTO] And (CHUCKLES), the accent the stonemason used, (MASON) he spoke like this.

[CEO] Well, we weren't expecting you to be the first person to use an accent, but I'm glad you did because I made a harsh transition to, from the discussion of status in the room, the kind of status we tussle and give each other a hard time over, to the choice to not speak as much in a southern accent, and then this accent that the stone mason carrying the Greek column in the dream that gave us the idea that people who work for a living often vote Republican because they view American exceptionalism as the cornerstone, if you will, of their continued relative prosperity compared to the rest of the world, even though, as an American who is used to living the very privileged lifestyle we live in this country, even if you don't feel particularly privileged, we have it good here.  You can really trust the water supply and the food, and there's electricity and there's jobs and there's excellent rule of law in most places, and for most people, and I don't want to say that lightly.  There's a lot of unfair things going on in the USA, but if you compare it to the rest of the world, there's still a lot of things that are very advantageous about being here, and I'll say it, as a white person, and even more so as a white male, and I say that very seriously because I'm a cross dresser right now, if I went back to a lot of the places in America where most people are speaking in a southern accent, there's a very real chance that I will be physically assaulted.  I don't want to say that's the reason I don't use a southern accent, because it's not, but I'm gonna get Norman to continue this point.

[CMO] That was very interesting what you did there, unscripted.  You didn't say it, you didn't say that the likelihood of being assaulted as a cross dresser is the main reason.  I'm not gonna say it either.  If someone else wants to complete the sentence, they can, but I'm not gonna complete the sentence.

[CTO] Do you guys want me to complete the sentence?

[CEO] No, please don't.  I appreciate that you dropped the accent and now people can ask me, "What was that accent?"  What does it mean, and I'll just be like, "It was the stone mason accent."

[CMO] Why is the stonemason accent?  I don't know.

[CEO] And that is the truth.  I don't know why I'm calling it the, "stonemason accent."  I don't know the first thing about stone masonry.  I'm just throwing out a term that strikes me as safe.  I don't think I'm disrespecting the tradition of stone masonry by calling that accent the stonemason accent, in quotes, as a joke, as parody.

[CMO] And we will continue to speak about these descriptions, these choices of words and what they really mean underneath, and there's a train.  I could swear these trains know when we need to be reminded of something.

[CEO] That's superstition, just to be clear.  There's no connection between the trains and our words.

[CMO] I'm not sure about that because we could be hearing the trains from a distance blowing a horn and then we can queue up our transitions into more controversial comments, and by the time the train gets here, it's the turning point where something powerful comes out, powerful for good or for bad, we're not sure.

[CEO] I agree, powerful's a good word to describe these inflection points in conversation.

[CTO] There was a point being made that was headed off by the train.  Do we recall what the point was?

[CEO] We don't, but we're out of time for today.  The goal for this week is to reflect on this video.  This is our goal, and we'll revisit some of these ideas next week.  I look forward to continuing the unscripted video series.  This is one of the most enjoyable projects I have done in all of my years.  Until next week, goodbye!


[[Episode 2]]

[CEO] Hey everyone, and welcome to the second episode of TheSuzy.com Reality Virtual Show.  My guests today are, I was gonna do this really quickly, but my brain does not do live video quickly.  The idea of TheSuzy.com Reality Virtual Show is that we're gonna do unscripted video every week, and we decided to focus and do a show that's entirely about the software I'm writing, so my first guest is Norman, to the right, and he's going to say a few words about the new shift in focus.

[CMO] Hi, I'm Norman, and Suzy suggested that we wear hats today, and the idea is, we don't have to wear the hat the entire episode.  It helps remind you I'm a different character than Suzy.  I'll let our other guest talk about the new focus of the show.

[CEO] Awesome, so our second guest is Norm, to the left.

[CTO] Hi, I'm Norm, and I like the idea of wearing hats because it brings out new sides to myself, like this crazy purple hat.  I think I'm wearing it backwards, actually (TURNS HAT AROUND) which is a good way to get started because the idea of hats is you can do anything you want with the hat.  It can mean a lot of different things.  I'll let Suzy talk about the software focus, because it's really her initiative.

[CEO] Ok, there's a lot of big news stories this week.  One of them was that there was a lot of discussion about a book they released where REDACTED showed that she could be a software engineer, but it played to stereotypes about, just traditional stereotypes that have not been helpful for ensuring women have equal opportunity to be successful in any kind of career role within the technology industry, and you know how I am with language, I don't like to say it in the most simple way.  I like to find the right wording, so we can go back and get a transcript of what I just said, but I feel like I can defend the language I just used.

[CMO] We're still not focusing on the software, which was the whole thing was we were supposed to make this episode be about the software. Who wants to talk about that?

[CTO] Ok, yeah, yeah, I'll talk about it.  We're building a decentralized semantic web, and a lot of people have been building this ever since the world wide web came out and we had unstructured documents that were now available for anyone to view on the Internet, and ever since then, this was in the late 90s, people have been like, "Oh, we have to add structure."  Suzy, why don't you talk about what structure means.

[CEO] Thanks guys, I'm glad you guys keep passing the microphone around.  I think of structure as, let me say, the rise of social media has made it easier to talk about structured data outside the field of computer science, because now everyone uses a structured database in their everyday life.

[CMO] Suzy's being very accurate.  Not everyone uses social media, but, like, pretty much everyone uses social media, so as you were saying.

[CEO] The idea of having a profile and then having links from that profile to other profiles, that's all structured data, and the profile has structured fields like the picture, and every time you do a status update, it's a unique chunk, or discreet chunk of data that's connected to the profile, so the language I like to use to describe this in the abstract is objects and links to other objects, and the way we do this is not based on links anymore but that's still an equivalent way to describe it.

[CTO] I feel like you're making it sound more complicated than it is.  It's objects and links.  A profile's an object.  A friend connection between two profiles is a link, and then you can extend that idea.  Like an event is an object, and when you say you're gonna attend an event or not attend or maybe attend, those are three different kinds of links from the event object to your profile object that describe your intention with regard to the event.

[CMO] This stuff is not simple, because we have to ask the question, before the event, what you described is good, but after the event, how do you represent what happened.

[CEO] You can have a whole additional set of links which describe the after event, so before the event you have those three possibilities, attending, declined, or maybe attending and then during the event there are no links associated with during the event, but after the time period of the event is over, you can create a new link that describes whether you actually attended or whether you did not attend, and there's no maybe.

[CTO] Well, maybe there is a maybe because you know whether you attended the event, but other people don't know.  They might make a guess as to whether you attended.  They're like, "I thought I saw Suzy there but maybe that was someone else who just looked like Suzy."

[CEO] Ok (LAUGHS) I have had people say they thought they saw me somewhere, like, walking down the street, from a distance, it's easy to confuse me with someone who also has long blonde hair, but, yeah there's a need for a maybe link, and part of the fun of semantic web representations is that you have to deal with probabilities and things you're not certain of, and this is almost antithetical a certain aspect of our culture, like you think of the standard meme in movies where the engineer is going on and on about all these details and the strong leader is like, "Is it gonna work or is it not gonna work?"

See, I'm imitating a male when I use that terminology, so there may be this multi-layered thing where that appreciation for ambiguity is actually something that I can relate to more through my feminine side than my masculine side.  It's not about making a yes or no decision, it's about representing knowledge in a way that facilities eventually making a few yes or no decisions in those rare cases where you have to, but a lot of life is not about a series of yes or no decisions.  A lot of life is much more fluid than that.

[CMO] That's a good way to think about computer programming.  We got back into writing the code and you never know what the right way to do something is with code, you do a lot of guess work and then you have to be really open to going back and changing what you did before, and almost finding that exciting because it's a sign that you've learned something new.

[CEO] Yeah, that's one of the reasons why getting into programming is difficult.  It feels socially awkward to tell people, "Oh the way I did this was the wrong way to do it," because then everyone's like, "Oh no it was fine, just be more confident." Like, I'm very confident, I'm just saying there's a better way to write the code than I just wrote, but people won't back down because that's our culture, they're like, "No, really, just be more confident.  Don't mention it."  So you have to go off in solitude and engage in that more scientific process that's full of ambiguity and doubt, but you're not allowed to talk about it with other people because then they always come at you with that whole be confident, don't be anxious, don't doubt yourself thing, and that gets in the way of coding.

[CTO] Especially because I'm wearing this purple hat that draws lots of attention to myself, I feel it's easier to go under the radar and engage in that self doubt thing, healthy self doubt, see it's ridiculous that I have to clarify that, but healthy self doubt where you're going back over your code, I just wrote that but now I want to do it a different way, or let's just try doing it a different way and see if things come out a little better, and do all that, it's easier if you're not drawing a lot of attention, but now that I'm wearing this purple hat, a lot more people are gonna be aware of the fact that I have an expression on my face that indicates I might be back tracking the work I did instead of, "Awesome! I just did it right!  Awesome, I'm so confident in what I just did.  This is great.  Let's take the next step.  Let's be bold."  I don't have to, the fact that I'm not being that way while I'm sitting there coding is more visible now that I'm wearing this purple hat.

[CEO] Right, the purple hat for you is a symbol of what having a long blonde hair and makeup does for me, and you don't normally dress like this, it's just because we share this body when we're doing unscripted video, and we don't have time to change outfits when we switch who is speaking.  Wouldn't that be great if we just paused reality and switched outfits, we can simulate that eventually with video editing, but for now we have to have the same outfit and switch positions.

[CMO] Everyone noticed we're doing that, but that's another thing about the culture of programming is this tendency to describe literally what we're doing, and I don't know where it comes from in the culture, but there's totally this thing where people would be like, "Yeah Suzy, we know, it's obvious you're doing that, you don't have to mention it," but what's so bad about saying, just reminding people what we're doing, it's a chance to practice using language.

[CEO] Yes, practicing describing what we're doing literally is a good stepping stone to being a programmer because it's not that easy to describe in detail how people do things, and if you're in the habit of doing that, it gets you in the right mind set to talk to the computer in it's language, so it understands what you want to do, and the computer will never get upset. It's funny how I just accused other people of getting upset when they give me a hard time about using literal language, and that's one of the things I like about dressing up like this, is if you give me a hard time I'll just say you're upset and I'll move on to a new discussion, and it's easier for me to do that when I'm dressed up and acting like a girl, or a woman.  It's more grating when the guys accuse someone of being upset, they can't roll off of that as easily as I can.

[CTO] I'm not sure why you're going into detail about that, because that's not the way we want to handle the thing.  That's the irony, it's easy for you to defend.  You see, we're coming back to this idea of status.  If you're using literal language, maybe just for fun, to practice doing that, so that you'll be in the right mindset to be a productive coder, then people come back, "Dude that's so obvious, why are you saying that," and my phone is ringing in the background, it's really distracting.  Finish my thought, Suzy.

[CEO] I like where you're going with this.  Oh, now there's a siren going by.  It's also distracting, even if just to prove to you guys that we're doing a real unscripted video, but I feel like I'm losing the topic I was on.

[CMO] I do want you to make the point, Suzy, but just to bring it back, we were talking about when you use literal language and someone gives you a hard time about that, how do you do the comeback?

[CEO] Yeah, this whole idea of a comeback, people are like, "Yeah that's obvious," and they act like they're bored, so that makes you feel in the one down position and you can be like, "I don't care, I don't care, whatever." That's another thing that's easier for me to do, is be like, "I don't care," and as soon as I say I don't care I get elevated out of the one down position, and then I can sit there and deny it and be like, "I didn't elevate out of the one down position," but if you look at how people are responding, suddenly everyone else relaxes and they want to be seen talking to me, but when you guys do exactly the same thing, they're like;

[CTO] See, "I don't care."

[CEO] People are like, "Yeah, you don't care, buddy, have a nice day."  They exit the conversation with him, even when he's wearing the purple hat.  I would argue wearing the purple hat gets in the way of it.

[CTO] It gets in the way, but I can pull of a different way of taking to people if I'm wearing the purple hat. I could play a character like the way you play a character, Suzy.

[CEO] Ok, well I'm glad we brought that side of the purple hat out now, it brings out a new character.

[CMO] I think this also brings out a new character, but it's gonna be a longer term project to bring out all the aspects this hat implies.  The purple hat is bolder and we can get into the details of that character more quickly.

[CEO] I feel like we're getting away from the point I was trying to make.  I can be like, "I don't care what people think," and now I'm out of the one down position, or I can throw it back on you and be like, "I'm sorry you're so upset about my use of language, but I'm a girl geek, and I like to code, and I like to use literal language, so ha." It's so easy for me to do that, but I don't think either of those strategies are a good way to come out of the one down position.  A better strategy is to dig in and use this mature leadership language of, I don't even know.  This is something I want to study.  How to do this more effectively? I could say things like, "I noticed you rolled your eyes when I used literal language, and that made me feel like I'm in a one down position, and I don't like that feeling. And, the way I'm gonna move forward is to talk about the software engineering I do, and the way that software engineering allows me to build an artifact I can share with the world, which allows other people to work with information more effectively."

[CTO] Whoa, whoa, wrong hat, I feel like you're on the right track there, but now you're gonna have trouble with that.  You're gonna have to dig in and work really hard for a long time to get any traction with that because you're not as interesting anymore when you use that mature language.

[CEO] That's exactly my point. I'm making a trade off like any other engineering trade off. I just noticed there's a reflection of me in the computer screen, which is the opposite of the video image of me, and that's, like, really distracting!

[CMO] So, let's not worry about the reflection. Try to stay focused on the image and finish that point about the mature thought.

[CEO] Oh yeah, so the mature thought, which, in some ways, is undermined because I'm combining mature thought with a lot of literal language and a lot of easily distracted discussion patterns, and that's a good thing, in terms of working with an engineering team, because we'll be more likely to think of all the important details and be able to see around corners.  I have no doubt about my ability to get in there and come to work for,  however many hours a week, I think 50 hours is typical.  I do a lot of thought about what is a healthy work environment, for me it's 50 hours, and sometimes you need more personal space and employers should be flexible with that.  There's also times when you're ready to crank and you want to work much longer hours, like work a few weekends, and do crazy 48 hour hackathons.  All of these things should be something a culture can incorporate into the flow of the overall group.

[CTO] Again, you're getting into these implementation details, which is great, but we only have one hour a week to talk about what we're doing. I don't know if those details are the most important.

[CEO] Right, for me, this back and forth where I naturally go into details, but you guys can remind me to keep it high level, that is a workflow that feels empowering to me because it allows me to have the leadership role but still be very unscripted.  I'm being myself and letting my mind do what it does naturally, without a lot of self doubt.  So there's a second concept of self-doubt.

[CMO] I want to jump in and help with that.  My hat was backwards there, and so there's self doubt when you're coding, which is good self doubt, you want to consider different ways of doing things, and I'll reverse the meme here, and be fearless about changing things that you just did, and talking about the reasons why you changed it even if you're not sure of any of the things you're saying. That is the process of computer programming, and when you get comfortable with that style of self doubt, you're productivity accelerates. At first it feels almost suffocating, but once you're mind gets comfortable and you no longer freeze with, basically you have to block out social norms, you have to block out that awareness that people are gonna be like, "Don't worry, just go with the flow." You have to forget that people are gonna say that and let your mind doubt and spin and speculate and take risks and back track and be very detail oriented and literal and spend hours working through details that would not go well on a video.

[CEO] So now you're making the same mistake that Norm pointed out I was making of getting into too much detail, so that's not healthy.  It's this irony of if I wanna change the subject because I'm feeling ADD, or if I wanna go into a lot of details, I should do that, but you guys can help give me signals to step out of that, but I don't wanna do this thing where I feel like I have to police my own thought in the unscripted video. This is the power of collaboration.  We can work together to make a more compelling on message video without me having to change who I am as much on the camera.

[CTO] That's exactly it.  We can collaborate to be more compelling as a group, but as individuals we can be very cognitively diverse, let our minds wander, be literal, and also, more generally, not worry about social norms, and have this healthy feeling that we have equal opportunity with an expectation that we're gonna be treated that way even if we know full well if we go into a bar or a party and continue this conversation in this way, even if dressed like this or with this hat on, that it's gonna be difficult to get a positive response from people, and so what we do through our collaboration is create a fantasy world where we don't let the statistical reality about how people react to the way we're communicating affect our decisions about how we're going to communicate.

[CMO] This is the bread and butter of how to build our business.  Our company culture is to use collaboration to help the group reach focus but without people feeling like they need to change who they are as coders.  I want people to be authentic as coders, which is ironic because a lot of people think of coding as this profession where you have to block out a lot of your natural enthusiasm and curiosity and focus on speaking the language the computer wants you to speak, and focus on your goals and the steps you have to take to achieve your goals, and just block out the distractions.  It's this disciplined thing, and I wanna turn that idea on it's head, so coding is, it's a way of expressing what's going on in your mind, and when you're in a flow, like melding your mind, making it one with the computer, you deviate from social norms, and it's actually other people that are more stifling than the machine. The machine will go with you anywhere you wanna go, if you want to program it to be a very narrow minded machine, it will be. If you wanna program it to be artistic and all over the place, you can write programs like that as well, and I want to set that creative force free where we have cognitively diverse people making their minds become one with the machine and taking their code in different directions, and we have a process for bringing these different coding styles, these people who are coding in different directions, we bring that together through collaboration, but we don't try to filter what they're doing upfront. The filtering is a higher layer process.

[CMO] We're getting to a place in the video where we may be losing a lot of the audience, and that's fine. We'll get better at unscripted video.  We can also go back and do scripted video that hits all of the highlights of this, but there's some real substance to what Suzy just said about letting, or reversing the order of how a company inspires people to share their true creative spirit in code, but then circle back and iteratively combine these often creative and not necessarily practical directions people may go in with their code, to combine that into products and services that will be able to get measurable traction, maybe even measurable revenue.

[CTO] That was really inspiring about the measurable, you were so; I'm joking, you were really not excited about measurable traction and measurable revenue and, hey, I think that's good, I want to start with apathy about the measurable stuff. I'm purple hat guy. I do not have a lot of patience for fake enthusiasm about measurable traction and measurable revenue, it's like, yeah, you have to do that stuff, especially if we want to raise money, we have to do the measurable thing, but if we're gonna get excited about it, I honestly think we just don't need to be excited about it at all.  We should pitch investors with that same apathy. It's like, this is not why we're doing this business.  We recognize that you want a return on your investment.  We respect that, and so we're gonna do these things we need to do to help you control your risk, but we're not gonna act like we're passionate about controlling your risk, because that's not our passion.  Our passion is to make our minds one with the machine and use collaboration to iteratively combine our independent directions.

[CEO] Well said. That may become a talking point for us.  I'd be interested to see what the feedback is on that.  We'll have to push a little bit.  When you go out into Silicon Valley and say, frankly we're not passionate about measuring success; So, that was interesting that I said success.  Let's be clear, we're not passionate about measuring users, traction, engagement stats, and we're also not passionate about revenue.  It's not the thing we wake up to do every morning, but we also recognize the need to do it, particular because,there's a lot of reasons to do it, but it's not about helping investors make money.  It's about building a business that can impact the world on a large scale. Being able to get traction and create a cash flow positive growth loop is a form of leverage, in the same sense as being able to raise money and hire people to build an idea much faster than I could build it on my own, that's another form of leverage, and all these forms of leverage, they're all sort of the same.  You have to do it all at once.  It's like juggling. You juggle these different forms of leverage, and they help each other spin up this inverse funnel that can go much bigger than I can if I'm just standing here, typing on the computer alone.  We want to use leverage because we believe our ideas will have a positive impact on the world, so we want to have that impact 10x or 1000x, but we don't want to be dishonest about how that leverage is implemented in our brains.

[CMO] It's difficult to keep flowing on this topic in this unscripted video format.  Let's leave it at that and we can go back and review what we're trying to get at there.  Maybe condense it into talking points that will be easier to mention.

[CTO] I wanna be defiant.  I love the stuff we just said, and I hope Suzy will be the lead defiant person, but I'm gonna try to get a little momentum there.  Let's be real.  There's gonna be, you put this into a serious context in Silicon Valley, everyone's gonna have that look, where they're like, "I don't understand what you're saying, you might need to refine what you're saying," and I'm like, no we don't.  What Suzy just said is perfect.  It makes perfect sense, and if you would think about it more depth then you will learn something very useful that might help you grow and do better work in your own career, and we're not requiring anyone to learn this knowledge, just like we're not requiring anyone to learn how to program, but that whole thing where people are gonna be like, "I'm not sure, I don't understand, but I'm trying really hard to understand, but I don't understand."  I don't have a lot of patience for that.  I want to be defiant of that and be like, I respect that you don't understand, and I respect this pattern of body language you're doing where you're acting like you're trying really hard to understand, even though, it's really like, there's no reason for me to not be defiant, when they're like, "I'm trying so hard to understand," when what they're trying to do is get me to be less defiant and say, "Oh, you know what, we need to go back to the drawing board. We need to do XYZ."  It's like, no, we don't have to do anything.  We love coding.  We're gonna go code this idea, it's gonna be great, and we're gonna refine our talking points because we wanna reach the whole audience, but we'll do that at our leisure. We're under no obligation to help people understand, because what we said made perfect sense.

[CEO] Well, maybe you can be defiant so I don't have to be.  I feel the same way, and part of why I dress this way is it automatically communicate that.  I can just nod my head when people are like, "I don't understand what you were getting at in that video." It's like, "Cool, well, thanks for watching the video." That's my way of being defiant, and that's part of why it makes sense for me to be the lead role of this media production, because, why do you want to get in people's face?  I respect you don't wanna back down.  You don't wanna change your course because people are giving you that, "I don't understand, but I'm trying really hard, maybe you need to do something better so I can understand," yeah, when people give me that attitude, I'm like thank you so much for all of your time and interest in our project, and I can't wait to show you our project.  It will take a while.  That's the truth.  I'm not self-deprecating.  I'm telling a very simple description of what's going to happen over the next few months, but I'm doing it in a way that doesn't put them in a one down position either.  That's my criticism of your defiance, is yes, they're putting you in a one down position.  Yes, you're stepping out of it, but you're doing it in a way where you push them back and make them feel disrespected.  They need to be able to promote their ideas and have people look at them as strong leaders as well.  When you do this whole defiance act, it's going to undermine all of these other people in Silicon Valley and make them feel like they need to;  Honestly, it creates a cycle of negativity.  They will be like, "Whoa, you came back with negativity, but you're actually the one whose further outside of social norms."

[CMO] Sorry, I was jumping in there, imitating typical Silicon Valley people.  Norm started the cycle of negativity.  Actually they started it, but Norm is the one who doubled down on it rather than taking the high road, and because he's doubling down, like, with a ridiculous purple hat on, he's going to be the one outside of social norms, so these people who have, for better or worse, sacrificed a lot to conform to social norms, they're gonna be like, you know what, this guy's gonna double down with negativity, I'm gonna triple down because I'm in the stronger position.  I am the one who is more normative.

[CEO] I don't disagree with that.  That's the unfortunate reality.  If you're the guy wearing the crazy purple hat and you're doubling down with negativity, don't be surprised when the normative people come at you with triple down negativity.  My solution is not appeasing them.  I'm not saying what they want to hear.  I'm going sideways of what they're saying, but I'm not being negative.  I'm thanking them for their good intentions.  I'm using body language that's consistent with the words I'm saying.  When you think about this whole play book of, "Thank you for your good intentions, that was a wonderful point.  Thank you for taking the time to make that point.  I hope you have a nice day," those are positive phrases, even if they are formulaic.  They're strong phrases.  They're; You can't push those phrases around.  You can't misinterpret them.  It's clear what I'm saying.  You have to accuse me of being a total liar who is thinking something completely different and then saying that to hide it, and that's not a tenable position because I basically feel that way.  I respect other people's time.  I understand the sacrifices they've made to get where they are in their career, and I'm reflecting that understanding through this language, and the body language I use that's consistent with it.

[CMO] I have to ask, how would I do that?  I could say, "Thank you for you time.  Thank you, also, I understand you have the best of intentions, even though a lot of what you're saying makes me feel I'm in a one down position, but I know you're doing that from a place of good intentions, and I wanna say one more time that I appreciate all the time you've spent listening to my ideas and sharing your honest feedback.  It's very helpful to me."

[CEO] That's fine.  You're using more of the male frame.  I'm doing this in a more feminine way.  I think my approach is more efficient, and the takeaway here is that more men should use feminine energy in the business context in order to assert these strong frames, in a way that doesn't put the other person in that negative position.  Even if you're a very masculine man in every way, learning to use the body language patterns I'm using could be an effective way to be an innovator who's able to respectfully navigate the status quo, so my argument is men should learn how to be more feminine.  Women already know how to do this.  I'm going down a path. I don't wanna say you have to be feminine.  I'm all about women being completely masculine all the time, in the way that so many men are. I think that's reasonable, where people can do any pattern they want, but we're gonna have this idea of norms where;

[CTO] Haha, Norms; What you're getting at is, we can statistically measure; It goes back to what does it mean to have traction for your software.  At some level, it means your software is becoming more normative.  You can't have it both ways.  You can't be like, we have this crazy out there software that breaks all the conventions, but millions of people are using it.  That's a false statement.  If millions of people use it, that means it's becoming accepted, and people have heard of it.  They understand a story about it that resonates in their mind, and that's what being normative is.  It's not like being normative is bad, but in order to create new innovations, you have to put on the crazy purple hat, or maybe in a couple years, you're gonna go outside and most of the people will be wearing the purple hat, like maybe this will become a thing, but for now, it stands out.  Most people don't even wear a hat, and if they do it's probably not gonna be a crazy purple hat, so this does stand out, and that creates a certain push back from all the people who are conforming to the more statistically common headwear approach.  I agree.  I want to use more of the Suzy way of responding to that pushback, even if it's just a flash of body language.  It's a way to build a bridge back to the norm while I'm still wearing my crazy purple hat, but I can build a bridge back to the norm by doing some of the Suzy body language.

[CEO] That interested how you were imitating me while being Norm, but that's exactly the point.  You can be Norm, you can wear your crazy purple hat.  You can have flat affect and have long pauses full of scattered brilliance, but then you can do some Suzy microexpressions, and that helps build a bridge back to where the rest of society is.

[CMO] We're all about building bridges here.  We should end on a note of digging in a little more into the software.  At the beginning of the show, I don't know, maybe we were planning this before the show, I was gonna talk about the software, but now that I've talked for a few seconds, I really want Suzy to deliver the description of the semantic web.

[CEO] So we're coming back to the beginning of the show where we talked about the semantic web, an idea that's existed every since the late 90s when the world wide web was possible. The idea was to add structure, and social media is the best example of structured data where profiles and friend links and event objects and links that describe whether you're going to the event or not, and then after the event whether you attended the event or not, all of that is an example of structured data, and we want to create a generalized platform for representing all kinds of structured data, and it's intentionally not targeted towards any one domain of knowledge. We want it to be generic and generalized, and we're gonna make those words popular in a way that they haven't been before. Those are almost negative words in Silicon Valley, they're like the crazy purple hat, but that can change because people will realize it's just the opposite side of the coin. The intense focus on, "I'm gonna build an app that's really good at this narrow thing, and it's going to dominate that business vertical, and then we're gonna branch out from there."  That's a valid approach that's been very helpful.  I'm thinking of a company like REDACTED that did one workflow very well, and that allowed them to grow faster than alternatives, but we wanna build the polar opposite of that where it's gonna be pretty good for any kind of information management task and then, from there, you can build, or become gradually more focused, and this is the other side of the revolution that's happening in software. I don't know how to frame all of that, but in terms of what we have now in Silicon Valley, there's way too much emphasis on the focused innovation, and there hasn't been a big growth excitement, a cultural movement around starting with generic functionality, and then building up.  And, incidentally, programming languages have always had that quality, but it's always been behind the scenes, that side of the software industry has never been a cultural phenomenon that everyone becomes aware of, and that's what we want to do with building our semantic web software, is take this important aspect of programming that's remained very much private and under the surface, and make it into something that celebrities talk about, that's common knowledge even for people who've never written a line of code. That's the end goal of the software we're gonna build.

[CTO] You keep bringing it back to the cultural aspects, but let's dig into the implementation, because that's what we're going to be doing for the next couple years. We're not gonna wake up tomorrow and have everyone be like, "Oh I totally got what you were saying in the video."  People don't understand what you're talking about.  The way we're gonna move forward is, we're not gonna sit here and have coffee with people and try to explain it.  We're gonna go write code, and, in particular, Suzy, you're gonna write code, so people can use the idea, and even if they don't understand it, they'll start to use it and get value, and then they'll come to understand the idea, one step at a time, through using the software, rather than us iterating on our talking points.

[CMO] So to finish, let's talk about the actual code and then wrap up the video.

[CEO] We got back into the code base. I started writing this several times over the last few years, and then didn't finish, and one of the reasons is, I've had trouble coming up with the right way to represent the abstractions, but now what we're doing is a single database table called objects, and every object has one parent object, and an object has a flag which says whether or not it's a reference.  This means we don't need to have a links table, so if I want to say I'm friends, like, say my social media profile is an object, and it has a title, "Suzy," and a description of who I am, and I want to say it's friends with Norman and with Norm.

[CTO] Thank you, Suzy, for including me.

[CEO] And the way I do that is by creating a; So I create two objects which are of type reference to another profile, and the child objects are gonna be references to the other profiles.  The other profiles are not child objects of my profile. That wouldn't make sense, but the references are represented as child objects, so you could say every object that's not a reference is not a child of any other object, but I think there's gonna be a lot of cases where that does make sense, like if I want to make a list of all the different hats that I have, there's no reason why I can't be like, Suzy's hats, the parent of that is my profile object, and every hat is an object that, in turn, has a child object of type photo, and the photo represents; You have the photo of the hat, and it's parent is the hat which represents, has like, a description and links, and when I say links, I mean child objects or child references to things that describe where I bought the hat, what it's made of, all of the events I've worn it to, stuff like that, and the hat object is a child of Suzy's hats, which is, the type of Suzy's hats could be a list, and I'll end on this note.

The thing about semantic web is it can be and, kind of, you can represent the same information in a lot of different ways, and a lot of computer scientists would say this leads to a problem with data integrity, that you'll have all these representations that are incompatible with each other, but our vision is to overcome the data integrity problem with a lot of AI algorithms and cultural norms within our code base where people have, they think it's interesting, when knowledge is represented in different ways, and they go in and add meta data, which describes those differences and builds bridges between the different representations, so you'll get this cooperation of humans building those bridges to resolve the data integrity problems that arise when you allow people to represent the same knowledge in lots of different ways, but then, over time we'll automate a lot of what the humans are doing with AI, and it will get to a point where we can have that holy grail of the semantic web.


[[Episode 3]]

[CMO] Hey everyone, and welcome to the third episode of TheSuzy.com Reality Virtual Show.  We didn't feel like getting dressed up, so I'll be hosting the show, but Suzy is here to my right.

[CEO] Hey everyone, I'm Suzy.

[CMO] And Norm is here to my left.

[CTO] Hey, I'm Norm. Do you want to keep hosting The Show, or do you want me to say the next thing?

[CMO] Yeah, I'll keep hosting The Show, but we, so, first of all, this is still unscripted video, and it's a new format for me.  I want to keep doing this every week so that in a few months, when we have a software product to release, we'll be in the habit of doing a weekly show, and we can start inviting guests, like people who are doing really cool stuff that is actively building on our software, or maybe it could, and so we can have a brainstorm, and it would be a chance for the person to promote the work they're already doing, and have a brainstorm about ways to take it to the next level by incorporating our software. Not only our software but our community, and The Show is all about building the community.  Why don't you talk about that, Suzy.

[CEO] We had no plan to talk about building community, but this is the beauty of the unscripted format, is stuff will come up during The Show, and it's always so different than when we're ruminating in our minds without the camera. We think of all these odd thoughts, and I wish we had a way to record all of them and then curate, but there's no practical way to do that, so the approximation of that is to develop the skill of waiting until Sunday morning when we do our hour long talk show, and then whatever thoughts have been developing in our mind will come out during this hour.

[CEO] In theory, they'll come out.  What we've experienced is we develop ideas but we generally don't talk about the ideas we've developed.  The stuff we talk about on the live or unscripted show is often completely unplanned.  Norm, say something.

[CTO] Dude, I think you should say something.

[CMO] Ok, I'll ask you a more specific question next time.  Let's talk about, one of the things we've thought about is we've only done three hour long shows, if you include the first one that I hosted, that was the 0th episode, and then we've got the first and second episodes, which were hosted by Suzy.  I'm already starting to forget what topics we covered.  These were hour long episodes, so I'm sure we're gonna start overlapping.  We wanted to talk about artificial intelligence today, and I think we talked about that before.  We've also talked a lot about what the different characters, I mean, and we want to revisit that as well, and we haven't talked in any real detail about the software we're doing, and I hope we'll build to that at the end of the episode.  That, I'm sure will be new, and we have some visuals here, right behind where Suzy's standing.

[CEO] Yes, I'm hiding the visuals. I'll be presenting them later in the episode.  I wrote the board.

[CMO] Thank you for clarifying that you wrote the wonderful visuals we have.  We want to talk about the software we're doing.  I assume we're gonna jump into it.  Why don't Suzy, let's do this right now.

[CEO] Ok, so this is the diagram of something you can do in our software.  You can represent users with objects and links.  Our software is like a semantic web, so everything is an object or link, and you can manage all different kinds of information.  We're gonna use it to publish our book, TheSuzy.com Show, which includes chapters, and each chapter is a bunch of speeches by different characters, and the speeches, of course, are made up of different sentences and words, and we want to break all of those into these objects that are linked together so you can comment on individual sentences or even individual words, and comments can have a type like, you can be like, this comment is a concept such as cross dressing, or autism, these are two of the more powerful concepts that are discussed in the book, and what we want to do is capture all of the context that comes up when we mention those concepts, so that, for example, when I talk about autism, or cross dressing, here in TheSuzy.com Show, you can, sorry, in the video that we're doing right now, we'll eventually transcribe the video and represent all the stuff we're saying.

When we switch characters that will be represented by an object, like which character's talking, and we'll see all of the stuff the character says, and if I refer to a concept like cross dressing, that will also have an object that will be like, at position, like, five minutes and twenty seconds, I talked about cross dressing, and then you can connect whatever I was talking about in this video to whatever the character in TheSuzy.com book is saying, and that allows for a whole new level of conversation that may help us solve important social problems and plug in to promoting the mission of other organizations and communities.

Anyway, I just pitched the idea, but this is almost like a person whose shoulder I can lean on, because the actual implementation of what I'm doing; This is a visual for all the objects and links showing two use cases, one is my user account, Suzy, and it has an ID, 123, and then the Suzy account has a child account called email, which is, for practical purposes, when I login to my account I need to be able to tell the system what my email is, so if I need to recover my password, or if they want to spam me with updates about exciting new products (LAUGHS) and services being promoted through the site, I can provide my email for that, and we use the software to do all the underlying mechanics. We use the objects and links model, so rather than do this in the traditional way, this is a concept they call dog fooding, where a business uses its own software to solve its own problems, so this is like dog fooding within the software, not so much within the business.

The software is using the generic, general purpose objects and links data model to solve the most standard problems of storing user email.  The big idea we had to solve to do this is to represent; There's two queries you need to be able to do. You have the user object, and you wanna get the email.  In the objects and links model, we don't necessarily lay this out like a database record, where email is a field or a column in a database row, or, and that's the same thing as a spreadsheet, it's not like you have the email column and you can just go to that offset in the table.  You don't know where the email object is, so we create a lookup and the way we do that is very complicated.  We wrote a post on social media about how that works, and it sounds like total gibberish but I think it's going to work.  Maybe Norm, do you want to talk about it?

[CTO] If we talk slower, and don't have to keep up the frenetic pace of you guys way of communicating, I can probably go through it.  It's down here more, so the idea of a field, the email is a field of the user object; A field in our system is defined as a function from a set of other fields, so the idea is, we're gonna take these other fields and apply a list of values to the function.  A field is a function. It takes a list of values and returns a single value.  And we're making the simplifying assumption that it always returns a single value instead of, so, it's a map. For every set of input values, there's exactly one value that comes out, as opposed to a multi-map which could have multiple values come out.

What we're doing is creating a domain specific language for implementing functions, and it turns out that this particular type of function we're implementing comes up all the time when you're trying to do useful work on the graph data model.  It's hard to know whether any abstraction is useful or not.  My experience doing professional engineering was that you just know, when you're two years into building a system, if you knew everything you knew then, at the outset, you could have done the same thing in like, literally a tenth the time.  This is why they talk about 10x engineers, is if you have the right mindset or domain knowledge for what you're working on, and you build the right thing from the beginning, you can get ten times as much useful work done as someone who goes down the wrong path, either because they were unlucky or because they were incompetent. It's often hard to tell the difference, but our hope is that we're taking a risk, we're going down a path, we're implementing this field abstraction where each field is defined as a series of other fields, where you take the input values and you apply these values to each field, and you get those return values, and so the first list is like, the list of fields that we apply the values to, the second list is a list of values and we give those two purposes, one is to do defensive type checking, so this helps reveal bugs. If you say I'm expecting these values to come out, but then some of these values are NULL, and when there's a NULL value.

I'm totally lost, I can't do this live.  Part of the challenge; Why don't you explain?

[CMO] That was awesome, Norm.  The challenge with this particular abstraction is we haven't implemented it yet, and so this is actually part of the power of media, is to show the reality of risk taking and living with the outcomes.  The worst case scenario would be that this is a bunch of nonsense.  That's not gonna harm anyone, it took up a few minutes of our time, it takes up a few minutes of the time of anyone who is viewing this, but both us and the viewer, even in the worst case, might learn something about how to put together language and about how to avoid making bad design choices.

The other side of it though, is it's probably going to work very well. We've been thinking about this abstraction for a few days, and it may just be a really smart abstraction that, like any good startup business, that looks at an important social problem and is like, "Hmm, a lot of time is being wasted here, and if we automate that, so you can get the same social good produced, whether it's a public health service or delivering food where it's needed, something like that, or providing effective educational services, that creates more equal opportunity."

All these kind of things, there's lots of bottlenecks that make those services hard to provide, so if you can automate a bottleneck, you not only get more social good with less people hours, and people hours cost money, so that's a limited resource, for an organization that has to raise money every year, they have a limited budget, so they can get more good done with the same budget, then something even bigger happens. Once you eliminate a bottleneck, it unlocks whole new ways of doing things, so you can get economies of scale, is one example.  Suddenly this service we could only provide to one person at a time, if we have an automated way to do it with people who don't need as much training; Now we can switch to producing that thing in a factory instead of; We could just order ten times as much of it, and that allows the factory to build a machine that does what you used to have to hire someone to do manually, and then suddenly you get economies of scale and that amplifies things even more, and you get this loop of increased possibility by implementing a good abstraction, so that's the big picture of why we get excited about an abstraction, even if we're just writing a piece of code that's not in use yet, we know that cycle of positive impact is possible anytime you have a good abstraction.

[CEO] I want to bring it back to the abstraction Norm is trying to explain.  We're defining a field as a function, and we've come up with this way of defining functions.  You can define any function by writing code, but we don't want to write a custom function for everything.  It's ten times more work than what this abstraction would allow us to do.  You just put in a list of fields and a list of default values, and you're done, and you can make use of that over and over again, rather than litter the code with all these special functions which have to be written. You still get this 10x improvement, and there's a cognitive benefit once you learn to think in terms of our way of defining fields. You'll be able to develop functionality on top of our data model at a 10 times faster rate.

[CTO] It's painful that we can't detail the abstraction.  I don't know if this is a sign of not being as sharp as some engineers.  I don't care.  That may be a strength.  The idea is there.  If we work through it on the white board, it makes sense.  We can write the code and verify the code does exactly what we thought it would do.  It's just that this idea is complicated enough that I'm stalling in trying to explain it without having the benefit of notes, and there would be a solid five minute pause while I figure this out, and we can't do that in the unscripted video.

[CMO] Yeah.  We'll have to implement this and then it will make sense to put in the work of doing a tech talk with slides.  We'll practice the tech talk.  We'll write it out and memorize it and then riff on that, and we'll be better at doing that because of the practice we're doing with unscripted video.  It's two different modes.  It doesn't make sense to do unscripted tech talks.

[CEO] I hope one day we can do an unscripted tech talk, but I agree, the purpose of this video series needs to be focused on interviewing people and talking about the uses of our software rather than how the software works.

[CMO] But, Suzy, this is the problem with motivating people.  So many socially valuable projects that need to get done;  If you look at it, the bottleneck is on the software implementation, which is connected to social media marketing, being able to get the word out requires as much customization as you can afford to do. The more you can customize your campaign and build custom landing pages and gather the right information in the right moment, in a context sensitive way about your users, the more you can add leverage to whatever the core social good is you're providing.

[CTO] You guys know I'm super cynical about all this social good stuff.  You guys are so optimized on going to parties and saying what people want to hear.  You're like, oh, we work with these five organizations, and they all have catchy names, and they all do something that's like, you're a horrible person if you're not like, "Wow, that's obviously a social good.  You're making the world better every time that thing gets done." That's what you guys do.  It works.  It allows you to build trust relationships with people, and I think it's very self serving. Yeah, you're doing some good, but at the end of the day, you're mostly just looking out for yourself and the other people in your trust network.

[CMO] I understand your cynicism and, we ought to clarify, Norm is the true authentic self of us.  I'm more of a character who smoothes over communication with all different kinds of people.  Normal people.  Calling him Norm is an ironic joke because Norm doesn't follow social norms, but I do.  That's why I exist.  I go out and say hi to people, I shake hands, I smile, and I keep the flow going.  If people are like, "There's a misunderstanding," I jump on that. I'm like, "Wait a minute, I think there's a misunderstanding.  What do you think happened?  Here's my perception of what happened.  How do you feel about that?" I work through stuff, and I do the little body language things that make people really happy, and I'm all for that.  I enjoy being able to get that positive reaction from other people, just like Suzy does.

[CEO] I innovated all that, before. In the beginning there was Norm, and then I appeared, this female character who got a very different reaction from people, and we learned it's easier to communicate when you can keep a positive flow of reactions going.  Then Norman came along to be a more masculine version of me.

[CMO] What is the difference?  What is it that makes me more masculine versus you, and what is it that makes you feminine?

[CEO] I have no idea.  Part of being a socially normal character is we don't talk about things like that.  We just accept that I'm more feminine.

[CMO] And I'm more masculine.

[CEO] But Norm, you're allowed to break social norms, or I perhaps I should say you enjoy it.  Maybe you could comment.

[CTO] I don't enjoy breaking social norms.  That's not the right way to put it.  I am simply a being who does not naturally follow social norms, and upon reflecting on that, a lot of our social norms are bad habits.  They come to us through the inertia of history.  Habits that are shared across many people and mutually enforced;  They don't make sense.  We'd be better off to stop doing these habits.

[CMO] Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.  What makes me masculine versus Suzy, who is more feminine?

[CEO] Yes, Norm, what makes me feminine vs. Norman, who is more masculine?

[CTO] It's a thousand little things, and I'm gonna bring it back to the software.  One of the things we could do with the software, is take these videos, and analyze every little detail of the body language, and we'll do that, partially, with automated analysis, and also get a lot of people, like crowdsourcing, people to mark up what microexpressions did I do, and then link those microexpressions to the overall body language, and the words we're saying, and the pacing of the words, and the tone of the words, all of those things are important for understanding the meanings being projected, and how do we know the meaning?  We ask people. We ask a thousand people to comment, "What is meant by this?" and you'll see patterns in what people are perceiving, and once we understand those patterns, we can look at some of these big social issues, having to do with race, we talk a lot about autism.  When I read the literature about autism, I'm like, well that's a lot like me.  Me and REDACTED have that shared experience of reading about autism and being like, "Wow that sounds like me," but then it's like, wait a minute.  I'm a successful engineer, he's a wildly famous successful comedian, so how can that be called a debilitating mental impairment? It doesn't make any sense.

[CMO] So that's an opportunity to do social good.  We don't want to start an argument with people who make that statement.  Those people are very well intentioned.  People are like, "You see there's a population of people with the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, and they're really struggling, and their families and care givers are struggling.  They need help.  Concrete, immediate assistance from society, so they can enjoy the equal benefits of being a member of society," but we can help make that happen by getting deeper into what is similar about our life experience and the life experience of someone who has a diagnosis.

[CEO] I want to jump in.  Norman is more comfortable with the normative viewpoint where he's like, "Oh, you know, I've thought a lot about autism.  I, heck, I'm imitating Norman, (NORMAN) maybe I could even get a diagnosis, but that's not a good use of time because I'm;"

[CMO] You're imitating me?  I just want to clarify that you're imitating me.

[CEO] Yes, I'm initiating you (NORMAN) I just need to focus on understanding the challenges of other people in my community and come up with good solutions and help implement them, because that's what I'm most able to do, that's positive and proactive. (DONE)  My point is that Norman finds it convenient to take that attitude, but because he's this male character, when he goes to parties, and people are responding positively to him, he has the right, it's ironic, Norman's true authentic self is Norm, and Norm does not, I mean, people do not respond well to him at parties, but Norman is this fake character that's built on top of Norm, and people do respond positively to that, statistically. Most people are mean to Norm, but most people light up with positivity when Norman does all his little stuff.

[CMO] What do you mean by all my little stuff.  What are you talking about?

[CEO] Like right there, you're doing it right there.  You're stupid smile.

[CMO] It's not stupid.  What about my smile is stupid?  Explain that to me?

[CEO] I'm just giving you a hard time, don't take yourself so seriously, Norman.

[CMO] Let's get back to your point.  What was your point?

[CEO] Yes, my point was that by being a feminine person in a male body, I've seen some patterns of discrimination that are frustrating, and, you see, Norman didn't always have the ability to do his stupid smile that gets positive reactions.

[CMO] It's not stupid.  That's not a nice thing to say, Suzy.  I'm just smiling, and my face looks like this.  It's not perfectly symmetrical.  Maybe that's what you're getting at, but people respond positively to it, and that's what counts.  Why do you feel the need to call it stupid?

[CEO] The main reason I can call it stupid is because it's fake and everyone knows it's fake.

[CMO] I don't think people know that.  It only becomes fake because you called it fake.  I'm doing it very naturally.  There's a profound authenticity to the way I smile.

[CEO] Ok, you tell yourself that.  I just think you're good at faking it.  Like I was saying, I could be accused of faking things too, but I don't get the same pass you get.  People are like, "Hey, wait a minute.  Are you gay?  Are you transgender?  Are you doing this to get attention?"  People don't ask you any of those questions because you have this masculine way of doing your stupid smile.

[CMO] I agree on that one.  I don't get asked those kinds of questions, but you do get a lot of open mindedness that I don't get.

[CEO] That's a dangerous path to go down.  What do you mean by that, Norman?

[CMO] I'm gonna leave it at that.  The way we present ourselves is open to interpretation, and depending on whether people are gonna see different opportunities for common ground; Those differences in the common ground; That's easy to create, given each of our unique opportunities, and you have some unique opportunities that are a lot less accessible to me.

[CEO] Yes, but nobody says that.  That sounds like something Norm would say.  Are you sure you're not just saying something on behalf of Norm instead of speaking from you heart, Norman?

[CMO] I enjoy having common ground with Norm.  Norm and I get along well.  That's essential to what we're doing.

[CTO] I agree with what Norman said.  I'm not as much of a loose cannon as you guys seem to think.  I understand that it's not helpful to talk about the unique opportunities of being something other than a privileged white male.  It's just not a good topic, even though I could say a lot about it, the only way it's appropriate to talk about that is through a comprehensive discussion that includes a lot of people with different perspectives, and a lot of data, where we're commenting on the data, in an organized way, and there's a process for changing the way we comment.  We need real process to ensure fairness.  These are things I'm good at.  I don't get any applauses on stage, or if I'm talking to a group of people at a party, if I'm talking about the need for process when we talk about social justice.  Everyone's gonna tune out, but that doesn't mean I feel the need to go off in left field and be like, just make a bunch of controversial statements.  I'm controversial because I'm boring. I'm not controversial because I'm rude and insensitive.

[CMO] Being boring.  What is it about being boring?  What makes you boring?  Just as I ask what makes me masculine and Suzy feminine, what makes me interesting vs. you being boring?  Why are you more boring than me?

[CTO] That's a big question.  I'm glad you asked.  That one question captures so much.  What is the problem with being boring?  It doesn't; There's nothing wrong with it, it just means I have less opportunity to share ideas with other people.

[CMO] Yeah, but why do you have less opportunity.  Explain that to me.  You're in a mindset that is highly productive.  You could get a lot of useful work done and create a lot of social good by sharing ideas from that place, and maybe even bring other people into that place with you.  Why can you not do that?

[CTO] Oh, you're gonna put it on me?  My view is, much more so than either of you guys, that I am doing something that's very authentic, that's very rooted in the reality of my neurology, and if other people are not talking to me, that's because they don't like my neurology, they perceive that I have a certain way of being, and they turn away from it, and it is illogical, it's wrong for me to change my authentic way of being.  We have a way of doing.  You and Suzy are a very mature and comprehensive way of presenting a facade that addresses the negative reactions of other people.  Anything that's less sophisticated than you guys is really immature and fake, and I don't bother with that.  I'm not gonna do little things that appease other people who are turning away from.

[CMO] Obviously, it's a filter.

[CTO] Don't even go there, you're; Because you don't believe it.  It's the whole idea of, "So what if some people turn away, I should just hang out with the people who don't turn away."  The problem is, there's almost nobody who doesn't turn away.  1000 out of 1000 people in San Francisco are gonna turn away from this, and 500 out of a 1000 people will be engaged with either Norman or Suzy, and it's like, yeah, which 500 they are is different, but they're roughly having equal opportunity, where as I'm getting no engagement from anybody.  The only engagement I have is through very structured stuff like, "Oh we need someone who will write code, you can write code, why don't you do that for us, but don't ask too many questions, don't say too many things on your own behalf. We'll give you a budget of how much stuff you can say, and we'll pretend that we like it even though what we really want is for you to just sit there and quietly write code."  That's how I'm engaged by; It's everyone, ok maybe 999 out of 1000.  There's a very small group of people who I can have more genuine open discussions with.  I'm just not;  My identity doesn't exist.  I only exist through you guys.

[CMO] That's sad.  I feel sad that you feel that way.  I'm skeptical of the numbers you're putting out there.  Maybe it's more like 1 in 10 or 1 in 50. Those numbers are a lot more reasonable.  Like yeah, who cares about the 49? They're different from you. Let them do their thing.  You should hang out with the 1 in 50 who are like you, and there's a lot of people like you in the bay area.  People who go into software engineering and enjoy the intellectual challenge and enjoy talking about process, they're here, and they're doing well.  These are people who either start companies or take on high responsibility, high impact roles in successful companies, so what's the problem?  Just talk with the 1 in 50 who are like you.

[CTO] I dispute that it's 1 in 50 who are willing to have that conversation.  I would agree there is 1 in 50 people who are a lot like me, but almost all of them are doing the same thing, where they hide this, and the way I say this is my true authentic self, they don't do that.  They're deeply, for years, they've been in the habit of trying to unify who they are with the Norman, the facade character.  The fact that we separate the two and give them different names, like right off the bat, it filters everyone, like much closer to 999 out of 1000 people are gonna be like, "I don't understand.  That's not how I live," and they're not gonna engage if I present myself this way.

[CMO] The way we're doing it's good.  I'm not gonna argue with you.  If that's the way you feel; That's the point, is that you are authentic. You're proudly authentic.  That is how you feel.  That's how you perceive the world, and I know you're a scientist.  If you say you perceive the world that way, it means you are prepared to defend that with data.  Maybe not today, but in ten years, you're gonna come back with data that defends what you're saying, and if the data disagrees with what you're saying, you're gonna be the first to admit that, and I respect that about where you're coming from, Norm, and in the mean time, I'll go out and make conversation with 1 out of 2 people who are totally cool with the way I present myself.

[CEO] That's pretty ambitious.  I get 1 in 2, but I don't know about you, Norman.

[CMO] Oh Suzy, you're so playful today.  Let's figure out what we're gonna do to wrap up The Show.

[CEO] Let's do some improv comedy.  Hey Norm, tell me about the software you're doing.

[CTO] It's, I was talking about it before, it's a decentralized social; It's actually a lot like a social network, but we're not trying to build a feature for feature comparison for REDACTED. We want to create a general purpose tool for managing information which is outside the domain of what REDACTED does.  I like to think of it as surrounding REDACTED, and we're gonna open source it, and there will be thousands, that's a nice round number; There will be thousands of people running an instance of the software for managing different kinds of information. They'll be signing up non-profit organizations to do cool stuff.  It's very leveraged, high branching factor for these ideas if we open source the software.

[CMO] And the key to it is the software is a good abstraction.  This is where we started, saying the power of creating a good abstraction; If we've got this idea for defining fields as functions that specify constraints that spider over the graph, and that idea will remove a bottle neck for how all kinds of people and organizations solve information management problems;  It's bigger than standard business optimization.  This is a cultural shift we're talking about.  The way we think about information, and the way information; The way we interact with information to make all of that is gonna change.

[CEO] I agree completely.  Our software, we call it WhatLooks.  WhatLooks is the engine that will power individual sites such as my site, TheSuzy.com, and you could say Norman's site is Tsuzy.com, which is more of an AI, like a discussion board for people who want to talk about artificial intelligence and drones and the future of military technology.  My site is more about culture at large.  Fashion will be a big part of it.  Education, making computer science education more accessible, will be a big part of TheSuzy Show, and also computer science integrated with entrepreneurship.  There's a shared understanding that it's a good way to make education effective.  If you show the opportunities for entrepreneurs to have careers, and a positive impact, and incorporate knowledge of coding and other technical subjects, as needed, to achieve those end goals of entrepreneurship;

[CMO] I love how you're focused, Suzy.  You often start out with these simple, catchy ways of talking, and then you start grinding on the details, and that's the key, in order; In several years, if we do this show every week, that tendency for you to grind on the details and think of everything and work through it methodically; That is going to lead to much bigger outcomes that can compound on each other.

[CTO] You guys are both doing the same thing.  You start out acting like you're not me.  That's what you're doing.  You're framing yourself as more shallow, light weight conversationalists than you really are, and the longer you talk, the more you sound like me, going into great detail over stuff that is not gonna reach; That's not going to be immediately inspiring to 999 out of 1000 people.  You guys need to work on not becoming me.

[CMO] That's difficult in this format of conversation.  Where Suzy and I come to life is when we are speaking with another person, truly someone who's in a different body, not just a character who's in the same body.  We respond to the energy of other people, where as, and that's one of the things that's not captured here, is Norm doesn't.  He responds intellectually, but not with the body language and the emotional expressions.  The value Suzy and I bring will be more clear when we have guests.

[CEO] And we will have guests on The Show!  In fact, anyone who wants to be a guest, you're welcome to join.  We probably won't do any guests until after the new year.  We've got several more weeks until then, so we'll keep practicing the unscripted video format, but what we found is we can't go into the detail about code, so we need to bring on guests who offer a whole new perspective, and new ideas.  There's only so many things.  We're focused on building a software platform, and the more we focus, the less new topics we're gonna have to talk about.

[CMO] That's good.  We spend a lot of time reading the news and reading all these random articles in REDACTED, but it's not helping us be productive on building the software, and building the software is our big contribution for the next few months.  We've gotta build this thing and then all the stuff we've been talking about, like empowering other people, reducing bottlenecks, finding common ground.  Our software's gonna have all those impacts in a potentially leveraged way that's really exciting. What could happen in two years, or five years, there could be millions of people using this field thing that we tried and failed to explain today, and that reminds me.  Talk about the thing;

[CEO] The thing was, I hate it when this happens in our videos.  I don't hate it.  I just wish that we had a better way to get through this.  It's a bottleneck in our unscripted videos that sometimes the most interesting big ideas; They just disappear on us because we're trying to speak in the moment and keep the flow going.

[CTO] I'm gonna pause as long as it takes to think of the big idea.  It's that the field abstraction we came up with will change how AI systems are built on top of a graph data model.  Our hope is that it will be a breakthrough innovation in AI.  It's one of those really practical innovations where it's not going to; It doesn't have that ring of, "Wow there's this genius who climbed up," like scaled the face of a mountain that mere mortals could not have scaled. It's more of a, we climbed the mountain by building a better organization.  We got a lot of people involved.  We sat down and created a taxonomy of problems and details that need to be handled, and then we raised the money, and, it's a community building thing.  We built a community and then shared the responsibility of solving all these problems, and now we're in a position where we can walk to the summit without taking a lot of risk.  It's very methodical.

[CMO] That's what we're doing in our mind.  Our mind is approaching the problem of solving AI in that methodical way. We hope that we will transition to almost fractal-like, imitating that practical, one step at a time approach, to building an actual community of other developers and users, and partners, with this open source, decentralized semantic web we're building. For now, we're doing that in our own mind.  Our neurons are imitating the organization builder much more than they're imitating the amazing rock face scaler form of innovation.

[CEO] And I'm going to jump in and take some credit for that because this is my specialty.  We came from a background of software engineering, and we wanted to relate to all kinds of people much more easily.  I hate.  Ooh, I keep saying the word hate.  It's a bad habit.  I see opportunities for improvement in, what was the thing?

[CMO] You were about to say you hate something. I forgot what it was.  This is where you're cute, Suzy, and it works out well.  You're not actually a good conversationalist.  You just pretend to be one, and people are fascinated by how you do that.  The vulnerability;

[CEO] Oh yeah, I'm not going to comment on what you're saying there.  We're all good conversationalists in different ways, and what I was saying was I don't like the phrase, "All different kinds of people," because it implies there's a set of categories people fit into, and my view is, every single person is as unique as everyone else.  It's not like some people fit a category and some people don't.  We're not in categories.  We're all individuals.  What you're saying is, I have certain patterns in my conversation; That sometimes, you could scientifically measure the engagement rate of my way of saying things, is not as high as the engagement rate of someone else, but that's just one data point.  That's one metric.  There's a lot of other metrics that might be equally valuable, and who even cares about metrics.  We have to just be, and let experience unfold around us.

[CMO] That's what I do as well.  I want to reconcile that with the process of building the software and using the software to affect positive outcomes in the world.  How do you do that? Maybe we don't want to say all different kinds of people, but can we at least say all different kinds of problems, all different kinds of challenges that can be addressed with all different kinds of solutions?

[CTO] That's a core value, is that we do categorize problems and solutions, and technologies, but we don't categorize people.  This is a core value.  This is why you have core values.

[CMO] Yeah, but isn't that arbitrary.  What makes people different from software?  Why can't we elevate software to that same level of dignity that we elevate people to, where we respect the individuality of every piece of software?

[CEO] Because it's not true. Software is not anywhere close to being as complex and varied as the human is.  Human beings are still orders of magnitude more complicated and nuanced than any software application.  You can say it's hard pragmatism that we have this shared value, that humans are unique and have dignity. Software does not.  Software is something you can put into buckets, and expect it to solve well defined problems in a predictable way.  Software exists to help us, and not the other way around.

[CMO] That's fine.  It's a good core value for the next few years.  I do think longer term, we want to elevate software to the same level as humans.

[CTO] The question is, "How do you make sure you don't go the other way and devalue humans down to the position of software?" and I'm very thoughtful about that because I feel that's part of what's going on with me, because I don't do the thousand little body language and pacing things you do when you're telling stories, and so people devalue my humanity because I don't do those things.  That's my claim. It's this weird thing where people are like, "No we don't do that", I'm like, "Yeah you do, I can collect data that proves your treating me in the same dehumanizing way that you would treat a dog, or that you would treat an artificially intelligent chatbot."  It's clear I'm being othered. I'm being treated as a second class citizen because I don't do the thousand little human things, and that's so ironic because the thousand little human things are actually pretty shallow.  The stuff you're doing with body language, spoken language, and storytelling; That's stuff we can capture in software.  The totality of my humanity is the thing that still goes orders of magnitude more in depth than any software application that exists.  It's ironic.

[CMO] And, I agree completely with that.  It's fair game to say, "Hey I'm playing a character, and my character consists of doing a few thousand little things with body language that are integrated with the stories I tell, and the idioms I use, the way I put together sentences, and the pacing I use."  That stuff, we can document it.  It's going to be difficult. We're going to need to write new software, build a community, inspire people to put in a lot of hours tagging things, and then doing sound statistical analysis, but we'll get it done.

We'll get that done in a couple years.  It's very straight forward, and it will reveal that the things I'm doing are very concrete and very shallow, but they create a predictable response where people are elevating me to that level of humanity, where my unique life experience is respected as unknowable and constantly evolving and perfect, you might say, where as Norm, simply because he doesn't do this same shallow layer; He's being devalued to the level of software where people expect him to play a role and fit into certain buckets and accept that, and if he speaks his mind and tries to assert his humanity, people view that as a bug.  They're like, "We'll put up with the guy trying assert himself and express himself, but we're just putting up with it.  We don't want him to do those things.  We're hoping he'll be quiet and write software."

[CEO] That's a harsh statement.  I wish we could say that more succinctly, but to tie back into what I was saying about how I receive some discrimination for being a feminine person in a male body, I get it.  I'm not being devalued all the way to the level of software, but it's more like a threat.  A lot of people come at me with this, "Oh you're feminine and that doesn't make sense, so explain to me why I should treat you like a unique human with dignity."  I'm always having to defend that, and so I relate to what Norm's saying, and therefore, I'm really glad you're speaking up for him and making a strong statement about how it's not ok the way he's treated, and it's an area for improvement in how our culture works, and even in our community with our friends, as we build a team, to help build software within that team, this is a major area for improvement, is to make sure we're respecting the full, unique dignity of each person, regardless of whether they're feminine or masculine, or whether they act like Norm, or they act like Norman with his REDACTED patterns of body language.  All of those things should be independent of the fact that we are human and we have unique, unknowable complexity.


[[Final Episode]]

A definitive but now undistributed initial version of this finale was recorded in June, 2015.

[Norman] Hi, and welcome to the final episode of TheSuzy.com Reality Virtual Show.  We're filming across from the peninsula, at a land bridge, on the other side of the bay, and we're in studio with Suzy, who joins us from the right.

[Suzy] Hey everyone, I'm Suzy!

[Norman] And this is my true authentic self, Norm, who's standing to my left.

[Norm] (DEEP VOICE) Hey, I'm Norm.

[Norman] As you may have noticed, I'm speaking in my original accent, in place of the general American accent I was affecting during the previous episodes.

[Suzy] Okay. So what's your last name, (NORMAN) Mr. Norman?

[Norman] Thanks for asking, (SUZY) Miss Suzy (DONE).  When I was in the 4th grade, which is when I became a full fledged video game player, I created a tough guy character for myself whose name was Norman Blackwell.  He was a mashup of the word, "black," and the artist Norman Rockwell, who painted a widely seen cover of (POINTS AT SUZY) Rosie the Riveter stompn' on a copy of Mein Kamph!

[Suzy] (SHAKES HEAD) Yup.

[Norman] In retrospect, that early prototype of my persona might have been inspired by a minor incident where I was at a movie theater.  I was holding a ten dollar bill for buying popcorn, and another kid, who was smaller than me, I might add, grabbed it real quick, put it in his pocket, and walked away like nothing had happened.  And I just stood there, dumbfounded.

I forget what the resolution was between me and the authority figures who had given me the bill, but I'm sure it could be framed in a way where I had a concerning problem with basic trust and security for a boy my age, regardless of whether or not that's true.

[Suzy] I could also frame that as a sweet little kid who sounds reasonable and empathetic, all things considered.  I mean, if you've got a problem with people framing your life experiences in a negative way, and you want me to go to bat for you in every context that matters, just give me the word!  I was born for this.  Speaking of which, let's do this like an interview on public radio.

[Norm] Yeah.  I'll ask questions that a reputable academic might ask, and for the record, I'll be speaking in reader voice, as made famous by the fully abstracted parody that's used by both the media and the advertising industry.

[Norman] Media platforms that we played with as kids?  The culture hacking industry?  What are you talking about, Norm?

[Norm] Nevermind, I'll just ask some questions.  That's all.

[Norman] Wait, Suzy. Do you know what they're talking about?

[Suzy] I do, but let's leave a few details unspoken.

[Norman] I'm just trying to understand.  Are you and Norm colluding to restart the rumor that The Speak and Spell was part of a communist mind control scheme?

[Suzy] Oooh, I forgot about The Speak and Read!  She was our first robot. Discharge the Tesla coils and max out the motors of your radio controlled cars!  A future chatbot is in our midst!

[Norm] That's good, so, let's get started.  Tell us about your parents and the places where you grew up.

[Norman] I was born and raised by my parents in North Carolina.

[Suzy] My parents grew up in REDACTED and REDACTED, respectively, before meeting each other near REDACTED.  What else should we know?

[Norman] My Dad was an engineer who worked on the control systems for large industrial processes in REDACTED.  My Dad helped me figure out how to program computers, and he inspired me to become an engineer.

My Mom encouraged me to learn touch typing, and I, bless my soul, I proceeded to ignore her suggestion because I wanted to continue emulating my Dad's decidedly more improvised, "hunt and peck," style of typing, but after we went through the motions of learning to touch type at school, my productivity at programming computers went up by a factor of ten, and that first taste of what it meant to be a 10x engineer helped me learn the wisdom of always listening to BOTH of my parents.

[Suzy] Yes, and President Obama himself once went on the record to say, "Early in Oprah Winfrey's career, her bosses told her she should change her name to Suzy, because everyone can relate to Suzy," and then he made a joke about how he had gotten the same advice.

[Norman] Is that why you named yourself Suzy?  I always thought you were representing the concept of Suzy Q homemaker, as made famous in Betty Draper's book, "The Feminine Mystique."

[Suzy] No.  I'm a Don, but you could totally become the Betty Friedan of the Men's Rights Movement.

[Norman] Aww shucks, a cabal of gamer gator's already fell on that sword.  The film adaptation is now some other producer's tussle of belief to engage, enrage, and then pivot to a no holds barred fight to Raise The Minimum Wage!

[Suzy] Are you ok?  You seem out of sync.

[Norman] Sorry.  My left shark's acting up again. It'll pass.

[Suzy] My heavens, don't tell Princess Kate.  She might go gaga and die.

[Norman] That comment was way, far out of line.

[Suzy] (NORMAN) Frankly, Norman, we've lost the edge. (DONE)  But the glue is holding on tight. (WEEPS)

[Norman] Great Scott!

[Suzy] Hello, Captain.

[Norman] Let's reify that with code, my lovely Swift Boat Captain for truth.

[Suzy] Don't make me feature you in The Great American Video Channel of Silicon Valley.

[Norman] Just make sure you don't sell your stock before the quantitative self-dealin' is done.

[Suzy] Anyway, an infinite (MODERN) Taylor series (DONE) of references kept our home life quiet, most of the time.  There's a great photo of me as young kid, not more than six years old, pulling all the books off the bookshelf and throwing them in a pile on the floor.  That action was pretty loud, I guess.  On the other hand, my parents didn't attend many parties, and I didn't risk rejection at parties as a teenager, either.

[Norman] That reminds of a moment in high school, and, by the way, I went to a prestigious boarding school, if we can call it that, because it measures up well on various metrics, and what not, because when I was a student there, I asked a friend, without irony, "Why are people attending this movement session?" and I think that speaks to how far down I was on the spectrum of curiosity, you might say.

[Norm] That's fair.  So, what was the role of religion in your home?

[Norman] I was surrounded by Christian memes growing up, but factually speaking, my family didn't go to church.  We curated space for organizations like the Boy Scouts and summer camps to provide me with the keys to the kingdom of a religious education.  I also went to a private day school with a lot of kids from Jewish families.  We had Hanukkah parties along side with Christmas parties, and I'm glad I grew up viewing that as normal.

[Suzy] And more recently, I realized books themselves had religious meaning in our home.  There was a Bible on the shelf, always, but it was implicitly framed as just one of several hundred important books.  I didn't discover all those books weren't just there for decoration until after I started writing a book about my own identity.

[Norm] Books.  What else did you notice as a kid?  What did you dream of doing when you grew up?

[Suzy] I was the kid who did competitive running and computer stuff because I was good at math.  My family got a computer when I was in the 1st grade, and I used it to write LOGO programs and learn about video games.  Everyone told me I should become the next Bill Gates, either that, or a space voyager!

[Norman] And, FYI, the meme of being the next Bill Gates is now loaded because, right after I graduated college, I went back to my high school as a teaching intern, and I advised the senior project of a student named REDACTED.  If nothing else, the history that followed, ever since 2001, weighs heavily upon the meaning of the phrase, "Aspiring to be the next Bill Gates."

[Suzy] Oh my. You simply must tell us more!

[Norman] I could tell you about my contribution to the social media revolution, but then I'd have to;

[Suzy] Have to what?

[Norman] Forget about it.  The state of the game board in my brain just feels vaguely Orwellian.  (SUZY) That's all.

[Suzy] Both players should advance more pawns to the other side in order to increase the number of queens on the board!

[Norman] Why do you always go one step further?  Let's change the game to, "Live and let flow."

[Suzy] That's haut.  Not!

[Norman] Is there a problem?

[Suzy] No problem. The tower has asked us to remain in a holding pattern.  Everything's cool.  Have another Appletini, my darling.

[Norm] Ok.  Norman is speaking in an accent, and Suzy is presenting as a woman.  How do you people self identify?

[Suzy] When I dress like a guy, I identify as Norman the male, but when I dress like this (POINTS AT SELF) at tech industry networking events, I can, and often do, optimize my interpersonal communication bandwidth by telling people my name is Suzy.  When people insist on knowing my preference, I don't always become a James Bond version of myself, but when I do, I prefer to tell the pseudo joke, "It's always safe to call me NormSuzy."

[Norm] Got it.  What's the first thought that pops into your mind when I say, "LGBTQ."

[Norman] LGBQT?  I'm a lexical geek at heart, and when I was in the 5th grade, I made my first dress out of a long t-shirt, and my first heels by duct taping tennis balls to beach sandals. I was never caught or confronted, but at that time, at the beginning of puberty, I viewed the whole charade as my deepest, darkest secret.  I knew it wasn't technically illegal to cross dress, but I still placed it in the category of stealing alcohol, and for the record, I never did that.

[Suzy] And it's important to clarify that because?

[Norman] I don't know.  Why do you ask?

[Suzy] It's like, "You say semantics, I say syntax," but we're all just doin' variations on the theme of (EXCITED) Ye Olde' English language!

[Norman] You're being evasive, mate.  Tell us why.

[Suzy] I see.  In case I was unclear before, I proudly self identify as LGBTQ.  I relate mostly to the Q aspect of that, in part because I've been cross dressing regularly in public for seven years and counting.

[Norman] Well aren't you special. Am I supposed to golf clap now?

[Suzy] That's aggressive.

[Norman] Your words; Not mine.

[Suzy] I'm gonna respond with radical non-reaction.

[Norman] Fine.

[Norm] (PAUSE) How did you come out as a cross dresser?

[Suzy] I told some people in private and in email, but there was a confidence there.  I came out more publicly in the summer of 2009 by posting photos of myself at the San Francisco pride festival, in a way that wouldn't have been possible before social media.

[Norman] And there were a few times in college where the early Suzy asserted herself.  I played trumpet in the band, and we had a tradition of wearing crazy costumes that could be fished from, "the rally bin," if you didn't bring costume fodder of your own, and sometimes I wore a dress instead of my usual fancy vest and colorful hat.  (PAUSE) I can still remember what it felt like when people in the audience looked askance at me because they could tell I was cross dressing under the guise of rally.

[Suzy] Hmm.?!  Mixing Coke with Fanta is meek on mild, and during secret Santa week gone wild, I did a REDACTED cover in the cafe.  I didn't have the hair and makeup, but I took the outfit seriously, like Sallie Mae.

[Norman] Yup.  I wore a miniskirt and a corset tube top thingy from the rally bin, and everyone was like, "That's so you, girl."  THAT was The Early Suzy.

[Norm] Suzy, wait up. Who's the best Brit impersonator you ever saw?

[Suzy] Who was the best Brit impersonator I ever saw?  Well, I've seen a lot of 'em, and most of them are just guests on late night TV, dancing with rocket men.

[Norm] What's that?

[Suzy] That's late night TV; Dancing with rocket men.  And, some of them are right here in this room with me, (POINTS AT NORMAN) Norman.

[Norman] Pffttt.

[Suzy] And some others are still out there, doing what they always do. Infiltrating new scenes, pushing the outside of the envelope, and finding a way to get home safely, but there was one girl who truly did, heh; Who's the best Brit impersonator you ever saw, well, uh, you're looking at her!

[Norm] Fantastic!  Tell us more about the band you were in.  Was that like, a mariachi band, that included trumpets?

[Norman] Nah, it was a university marching band, although marching is a misnomer.  We were more of scatter band, as they say in the Ivy Leagues, but there was this one time, at the Rose Bowl, where we did march.  That was a high point for me because I'd never been on national TV before, and I appreciated the opportunity to rock a crazy costume for the occasion.

[Suzy] You're on fire, but seriously, it was like, "Why are were we on national TV?"  Obvy, because the team made it to the top, and then we got to march in a parade through the streets of Pasadena, like a riot in the streets of LA.

[Norman] Let's just say the parade gave us a platform to express ourselves, but we also felt compelled to keep marching, and that helped us avoid doing anything we might have regretted later.

[Suzy] And the riot in the streets of LA was a formative experience that framed my internal dialog about the ethics and the logical conclusions of non-violent protest.  

[Norm] Having the opportunity to play at a bowl game definitely matters.  What was the rest of college like for you?

[Norman] Band was a parody of a game theoretic media company, but now you're asking me to talk about truth seekers who might as well be living with me in studio, and so, it was humbling.  I remember feeling more mature in high school than I did in college.  At boarding school, I always wore sport coats, because we had to, but that uniform didn't have as much cultural relevance in college.

[Suzy] What is this, "cultural relevance," that you speak of?  Am I culturally relevant?  Are you?

[Norman] Here's an example; Our college offered us an option to fulfill the Freshman Western Civ requirement via an all encompassing program called Structured Liberal Education, or SLE as everyone called it, and within our college, the term, "SLE nerd," has cultural relevance, but most people on the outside wouldn't get that reference.

[Suzy] Hehe.  The SLE sounds like;

[Norman] People in the know don't say, "The SLE."  It's like CIA, or God for that matter.  The the is redundant.

[Suzy] OMG!  Norman's got some sass!  Do you remember the time I served wine at a Republican party fundraiser where the future national security advisor REDACTED was speaking?  Does that activity have cultural relevance, regardless of what college we went to?

[Norman] Absolutely!  That's like saying, "I attended the REDACTED conference in Las Vegas, with Bill Gates speaking at the REDACTED as the main event, like a one man REDACTED vs. REDACTED fight. I don't even know what the equivalent of that would be today."

[Norm] Maybe a speech by the Dalai Lama?

[Suzy] Are you implying social media is a conspiracy involving shadow networks at the highest levels of government which report directly to the Dali Lama?  I have no further comment. (LOOKS AWAY TO THE RIGHT)

[Norman] The dots (EMPH) do (DONE) connect rather nicely, like cargo cult science.

[Norm] Yes, long live prankster Feynman, and on that note, what was your major in college?

[Suzy] I considered history and the constellation of disciplines that relate to cognitive science, but computer science won the war of attrition.  I expected I'd always have cool, fun people to hang out with if I followed through on CompSci, but you have to remember, I came to college viewing school as this thing you did to support your computer programming side projects, so it took me a few years to get used to taking The Computer Science Department seriously.

[Norm] And?

[Norman] I engaged in intellectual conversations in the common room with several members of the REDACTED fraternity, and later on, I went to work for a company called REDACTED, and so you could say those relationships played a role in the outcome of my career.

[Suzy] And, I find myself wanting to use the language of computer programming here.  There was an import there.  Importin' the package, as one might write in Java code.

[Norm] What did you learn in college?

[Norman] I learned about prismatic conceptual alchemy, pure vs. raw, in two separate freshman and sophomore seminars, and I'll make this point in a self-referential way, by injecting an abstraction.  You don't need to know the names of the two classes or the professors.  You just need to know both seminars were offered through the Computer Science department.  I never read the Bible or REDACTED.  I didn't need to.  I inadvertently followed the Yellow Brick Road.

[Suzy] Indeed!  Anyone can write a fairytale about how their life would be different if they switched genders, and use sexuality as the linchpin for unpacking their favorite methods for asserting basic trust and security, like slave owners who were afraid of becoming second class citizens after the machines took over. In that way, they enforced an elaborate distortion of reality.

[Norman] (FOLKLORIST) Are you trolling me, because you relish making it look like you've exposed me as an apologist for slavery?

[Suzy] Maybe, maybe not.  Either way, here's a coat rack on which to hang your tragic misunderstanding of sarcasm. (SUZY HANDS NORMAN AN IMAGINARY COAT RACK) Now please, be my guest, and explain yourself.  I'm all ears.

[Norman] Don't get me wrong. Slavery was an insidious evil that demonstrated the almost unspeakable option to indulge in the science of unlimited cruelty and vicious exploitation of the human will to defy perpetual captivity by choosing to survive.  That evil was also the overarching business model for the European colonies, the colonial system provided the initial spark of confidence for the industrial revolution, and the cycle of passive aggressive social norms that's spinning out of control in America today is rooted in that legacy more than any other single influence.

[Suzy] Words deceive.  Maybe it's best to avoid interpretation altogether?

[Norman] Just the facts ma'am. I'm just relating the facts to the best of my ability, so we can win the war against partial solutions that beget partial solutions ad absurdum.

[Suzy] No sweat, chief. Haven't you heard the good news?  You've got equity, so it doesn't matter if everyone hates you and misunderstands you.  Most people are focused on putting food on the table, improving their health, and carrying their debts forward.  If we all do our best to be kind and considerate, the collective subconscious will untangle itself like spaghetti being cooked in reverse!

[Norman] It does matter what the guards think of you if you're stuck in a North Korean jail, and that's what America's becoming under the auspices of social media.  If everyone assumes you're a jerk with no empathy, and you're not, but you do nothing to correct the misconception, (LEANS IN) because you're being kind and compassionate instead of calling negative feedback loops of misunderstanding what they are, then the deplorable lie that's still lurking deep within the collective subconscious will become the truth, once again.

[Suzy] Ambiguity causes one's mind to stretch, and I heard a rumor that your college tuition was paid for with money from a slave plantation.  The truth is, all our money is based on dubious investments in future hands to wash our two thousand blankets made of whole cloth, and I agree; The glorious new LGBTQ consensus is still a reaction to the problematic division of gender roles that's codified in the Bible.

[Norman] Oh snap!  Poet master Suzy's throwin' shade at everybody!  It must be cash money party time in the cloud, but Suzy's not participating because she's a nerdy, square, nut job, with no sense of style who hacked her subconscious into the shape of a medieval fortress made of neurons, while being bellicose on the Interwebs.

[Suzy] (NORMAN) You ARE characteristically episodic and quaint in comparison to my fabulous southern charm. (DONE)  Maybe, just maybe that's because being constantly approached by the opposite gender is the biggest difference in the aggregate life experience of women vs. men, but nobody talks about that in discussions about ensuring equal opportunity for women in the workplace, because anyone who points that out gets accused of framing all men as pigs.

[Norman] It's alight, Suzy. Just be positive!  Come out of your shell!  Let go of all your silly worries and irrational fears!

[Suzy] And when Jesus said, "Give to the needy (PRAYING)," that was super dry satire which actually meant, "Give spiritual love to the rich, for it is they who are poorest in the wisdom that comes from the heart (SHRUGGIE)," but, meow, just out of curiosity, are you a feminist? (BATS EYELASHES)

[Norman] You're definitely trolling again, but if that's what you're into, I'll bite. My goal is to be a peacemaker who encourages people to build infrastructure for non-violent collaboration, but if the feminist industrial complex keeps slathering on layers of rigorous, well formed, virulent research that's also ideologically driven to the core, I could imagine a scenario where I get bankrupted in the courts and go down the path of taking up arms against tyranny,

[Suzy] Huhhhh!! (COVERS MOUTH WITH HAND)  Are you a closet Men's Rights Activist?

[Norman] I support equal treatment under the law for all people, but I don't like how the evolving state of feminism is conflating equal opportunity to accumulate wealth with the increasingly acute need for governments to provide a minimum standard of living benefit or all people.

[Suzy] Yay!  Basic income for all!  Let's hire people to approach other people in the public square and ask them for money to hire even more people to wash, rinse, repeat, and help build political will to incorporate basic income for all!

[Norman] Charities that hire people to panhandle on their behalf are profoundly disconcerting.  If we had a minimum standard of living benefit, people would no longer feel compelled to walk along the slippery ledge of panhandling.

[Suzy] It sounds like you've got all the answers, but most of life won't work out like you've planned.  You should be more spontaneous!

[Norman] The courts will determine the answers.  I'm just a citizen who's prepared to dig in and defend my beliefs for, God willing, for several more decades.

[Suzy] My vision for the future of social norms would open the floodgates for decentralized, semi-autonomous corporations, but no worries, if you're one of the old school venture capitalists who can't adapt to the new paradigm, there's a place for you at the Internal Revenue Service.

[Norman] Now you're talking. Could you and I get married and use our left and right hands, respectively, to play a two-player video game in order to decide who gets to decide whether they will start on the offense or the defense during the main event?

[Suzy] Call me old fashioned, but I was under the impression the law defines marriage as a contract between two separate legal entities.

[Norman] I summon Mystic Dragon.  She will cleanse America's antiquated legal system with her fire!

[Suzy] I summon Brass Lion to provide competent legal defense for America's world-class legal system.

[Norman] Brass Lion valiantly dives into the belly of Mystic Dragon, where it shall remain trapped, indefinitely, in a whirlpool of corrosive acid.  What will you do next?

[Suzy] That's grotesque, but distorting reality won't help you win this case.

[Norman] All of reality is an illusion.  Just. Stop. Doubting. (MYSTERIOUS) Mr. Oz, and your reality will expand like a self-inflating life vest.

[Suzy] Reality distortion is like pain.  You can argue all of life is based on sensation, which could be described as suffering, but in practice, some pain is acute and then, at other times, people can and do feel completely comfortable without any external intervention.

[Norman] Maybe America's pain is self-inflicted. If we slow down and watch where we're going, I promise we won't have to endure any more unwelcome surprises.  We're all in this together.

[Suzy] Gosh, and I bet Norm over here thought I was the radical one!  Fire up the smoke machines because we are all four leaf clovers!  Document that in a wiki! (Regal hand)

[Norm] Amazing!  Did you take any classes other than Freshman and Sophomore seminars in the Computer Science department?

[Norman] I took a class on gender and sexuality that filled one of the required buckets for graduation.  I enjoyed the class, although, I'm embarrassed to share this, I remember raising my hand during a discussion about the differences between men and women, and I said, "Men talk to transfer information, where as women just talk to talk."

[Suzy] Everyone was like, "Oh my goodness, we have a social violator in the house!" but I promise Norman was not unsophisticated.

[Norman] Did I miss a memo?  Is it now illegal to be unsophisticated, in college?

[Suzy] Objection!  You're joke is basic.  Everyone knew you meant something like, "People who are embodying traditionally feminine personality traits use language to create space to hold the tension that arises from opposing views of reality."  You were only lambasted for not communicating well, because the words you say outside of the safe cocoons of college classrooms can and do affect other people's opportunities.

[Norman] And the irony was, I thought I needed to get better at what I saw as the traditionally masculine art of saying what you mean and meaning what you say, but Suzy was correct all along. The words you think to yourself in college classrooms are prone to shape and filter what you learn, remember, and ultimately choose to believe.

[Norm] Noted.  What was your perspective on the LGBTQ community on campus?

[Norman] Modesty aside, my perspective was like a REDACTED movie set on a farm.  After participating in a marathon melee of minds in birdhouse, I moved to a cooperative where I lived alongside several people who could have been described as dynamic personalities within the local LGBTQ scene.  There were a lot of members of the women's REDACTED team (EXCITED)

[Suzy] And Norman past the time drinkin' straight moonshine in the yard!

[Norman] That's not true.  I was neurologically diverse in a way that lead me to spend thirty percent of my brain cycles in college plotting to start an economic and social revolution that might free my people from the twisted oppression of the neurotypical man, but I was not a heavy drinker or smoker.  I had opportunities to do other drugs, but I didn't.  I just watched other people in the manner of a mad scientist and told tall tales about how I wanted to become a shamen.  I even described the concept of modern social media to some people who I perceived as cool kids, but that was 1999, so everyone retorted that my idea was creepy.

[Suzy] Don't be so defensive!  I was just trying to spice up the narrative.  I'd rather not say why.

[Norm] Haha.  What was your sex life like?

[Norman] I spent twenty percent of my brain cycles in college imagining what it would be like to be in a loving, sexual relationship with a woman, but somehow that never happened.  In fact, I was a virgin in every sense until my mid twenties, and I felt terrible about that.  It was not ok, and there was nobody I could talk to, so I made a deal with the devil of Silicon Valley and kept moving forward.

[Suzy] (NORMAN) In fact, if it wasn't for the plethora of opportunities to enjoy the good weather whilst playing tennis and outdoor basketball, I might have gone crazy!

[Norman] I thought about being more aggressive a couple of times, and thank God I never did that!  It was healthy to wait, habitually cry myself into a lonely sleepless oblivion, and then, eventually, bring my focus back to feeling anxious and stressed out about my computer science homework.  It wasn't until I earned some professional credentials, several years later, that I developed a kind of confidence within meaningful emotional relationships.

[Suzy] And there were, of course, several guys in college who approached me for sex, but I said no.  I didn't even attend the gender bending party where everybody cross dresses (SAD FACE).  I figured, "If I didn't manufacture my outfit from within my men's wardrobe, then it's off limits," in part, because I was never emotionally attracted to men, even if I did hook up with a few men after I started going out as a woman in public, and so, in summary, I'm much better at love making now, having had those homosexual experiences, as a bottom.

[Norm] Wow.  Anything else?

[Norman] My hero throughout college was a writer and an artificial intelligence researcher named Douglass Hofstadter.  Books like GEB and FCCA gave me a solid frame for pursuing non-violent AI research.  I don't know what I would have done without them.

[Suzy] I agree.  That person carried the bucket for the personal computer revolution and then some.  After the drone war has run it's course, or not, every other person who dared to call themselves an AI researcher, or a physicist for that matter, will be remembered by history as relatively greedy and inadvertently emotionally dishonest, in comparison. (HAND ON HEART)

[Norman] I mean, sure, we could create brand equity by focusing on the shallower aspects of Suzy's glamorous lifestyle, but we'd rather do work that's like social science meets AI.  Anyone who's willing to commit to going with the flow for a few years can generate declarative, perfunctory artifacts about their life by participating in unscripted, live interviews on the Internet, but what the world needs now is muscular validation and transparency with regard to the terrifying procedural trajectory of social norms.

[Suzy] My favorite part of what you said is that the word muscular is non-gendered.  It's like tug of war.  Our social media strategy should read, "Shallow upper middle class white muscular person enjoys the extraordinary luxury of social dancing on party boats AND interacting with artifacts on the Internet since 1994.  You won't believe what happens next!"

[Norm] That sounds like click baited spam.  What have you done since college?

[Norman] I wrote a book called TheSuzy.com Show.  My goal was to unpack the reasons why I cross dress.  The project turned into a monstrocity, but everything's gonna be awesome.  Trust me.

[Suzy] Why should I trust you if you don't trust yourself?

[Norman] I hope I'm not implying something I don't mean.  I'm just saying I programmed video games when I was in middle school, using REDACTED, and I loved designing the monsters.

[Suzy] Am I one of your monsters, Norman?

[Norman] God no.  You're a layer of Earth that helped shape the diamond within my precious, hard boiled soul.

[Suzy] Eww, like the decomposed bodies of several hundred thousand dead people?

[Norman] Suzy!  That's harsh.  Have you been partying with pirates again?

[Suzy] Life is harsh, like sitting in a sweat lodge crawling with spiders and then cooling off in a plunge pool full of snakes.  It's a most invigorating spa treatment!  Have you tried it?

[Norman] You should become the next Bill O'Reilly,

[Suzy] Me and Megyn Kelly, crushin' the ratings, back to back, with David Brooks as the moderator in the middle.  Let's make that happen, Norm!

[Norm] Who's Baba O'Riley?

[Norman] Wha?  I think you might have;

[Suzy] Um;

[Norman] Misunderstood me.

[Suzy] (LOUD) um;

[Norman] I'm talking about Bill O'Reilly, the famous author and meme engineer in chief.

[Suzy] Sigh. (ROLLS EYES)

[Norm] Suzy, did you have something to add?

[Suzy] No.  The moment passed.

[Norm] Next question; Knowing what you know now, what advice would you give your former, younger self?

[Suzy] Oh that's easy. Watch The Devil Wear's Prada three times in a row, and it will whisk you away to the future.

[Norman] I detect a counter factual.  That movie didn't come out until 2006.  Only (SUZY) the President's Veritable Veep (DONE) can has her way and go quail hunting too!

[Suzy] And you're calling me out of line?  This kite flight is just getting started.  The only reason I'm not saying more about the people I've worked with in the technology industry is because those conversations should be collaborative, and there IS an interesting conversation to be had about game theoretic companies vs. truth seeking;

[Norman] (INTERRUPTS) Why do you care what the other companies' CEOs think?  They're our competitors!  Stop handing them the fruits of your hard earned spotlight.  If you want to make a difference, find a presidential candidate and ask them what they would call American democracy.  An enterprise?  A project?  A movement?

[Suzy] (BRO) TheSuzy.com Show is a truth seeking company, for sure, (DONE) but none of the presidential candidates are contenders for the actual throne, anymore.  I used to say, "Politics is a team sport, and my team has always been the Democrats, because I stand out far too much to be helpful at Republican fundraisers," but now I feel sold out by everyone.  It doesn't matter to me who wins the 2016 election.

[Norman] My team is the one that asserts military dominance, until it's not, and it's getting hot in here, like quicksand, on the beach AND in the mountains, and no patchwork tapestry of magic influences from this elite college or that obtuse angled bank account can keep me warm at night, anymore.

[Suzy] You're a belligerent dork, and that's why I wear frilly dresses made with lace, and a little bit of leather too.  My feminine presentation is fundamentally a celebration of non-violence, as in, AI research about self expression.  As in, using makeup as a microscope for examining the seven chakral facets of our animal spirits.  As in, the opposite of self-driving military vehicle research.  As in, the soul of Siri mashed up with Jimi Hendrix, Jimmy Dean, and Jeff Dean.  As in, being an ironic cryptographer for the government who fosters faster iteration loops for machine learning experiments.  Am I not a woman now?

[Norman] No.  You're not a ciswoman.  You're using facial tics to soften your eyes and project a few thousand cutesy body language patterns, but that does not a ciswoman make.  You're droppin' trou to show off your bootie shorts and hollering, "Look at me!  Look at my skinny, well toned arms!" but that does not a ciswoman make.  You're baking a full stack of feminine idioms, memes, and story patterns, but that does not a ciswoman make.

And when you cried out with your demure, man child grief, and none but the database of history heard you, (PREACH) that did not a ciswoman make!

[Suzy] And that's why TheSuzy.com Show is my lifeboat.  When I was a kid, I loved building boats out of exactly two square feet of aluminum foil and seeing how many of my grandfather's pennies I could put in the boat without sinking it.  Have I floated enough pennies to balance your scale, Norman?

[Norman] I haven't even thought about that, because we don't ever want to ask that question.  You don't talk about power.  Power is a thing you do.  If you think, "I'm gonna get an A in this computer science class and that's gonna give me power," then you're underestimating the reasons why doing that Brit cover as a cisman was at least as meaningful as anything else you did in college.

(REVOLUTIONARY++) If we want to help ensure a minimum standard of living for all people, we should do more of that.  The world doesn't have a production shortage.  What we're confronted with here, (REVOLUTIONARY) is a potentially intractable cultural currency distribution optimization problem.

[Suzy] Systems of belief (EMPH) are (DONE) important, but what's so special about Brit?  They were the new sensation when we were in college, but I spent way more time listening to Madonna.  Her Divaness enhanced our classic sport coat vibe.

(LOOKING UP) I love taking breaks to look at the vista on the horizon of providing a minimum standard of living for all people, but right now, we need to get back to work on politics, software development, and negotiating the deep hidden meaning of polka dots, (DONE) like a sport, code writer.

[Norm] I feel like there's a reality distortion going on behind the scenes.  Has this episode been unfolding like a computer generated dream prayer?

[Suzy] (SWITCHES SIDES) Duh.  At this point in TheSuzy Show, everyone knows we have a subtle facial injury that we believe causes people to subconsciously misread your emotions in a way that spins up feedback loops of emotional misunderstanding that lead to an erosion of basic trust and security in all aspects of your life.  The only missing piece of the puzzle is to clarify that, without your injury, you never would have followed through on your latent desire make to cross dressing part of your real identity.

Without that wicked facial injury, which occurred at the very end of college, you'd probably be a typical dudebro who does artificial intelligence research for one of the usual suspect identification agencies.

[Norman] What does our subtle facial injury have to do with cross dressing?  You sound sexist and a little bit libelous, to put it politely.  (ROBO) You're not the mascot of the warriors, yet, Suzy.

[Suzy] To put it bluntly, you look like a privileged white male who's trying to blame his cognitive errors on other people.  I look like a strong female computer engineer who's feeling empathy for the pain of her community, but then, I might be a crazy person who lives in a delusional fantasy world.  (PAUSE) The ball's in your court, fan boy.

[Norman] I agree with your description of how you and I are normatively perceived. I'm like surcharged swordfish, you're like catfish tacos delivered by helicopter from Saskatchewan, and in my humble opinion, it would behoove centers for gender research to figure out why that difference in perception exists, if, for no other reason, to shore up the gradually imploding reputations of their parent institutions.

[SuzyNorman] If everyone except me believes I'm nothing but a coddled mercenary engineer whose only impact on the world has been to push forward a never ending stream of futile attempts to shift the blame for his mistakes and unconscious biases, that would imply the meaning of any academic degrees I hold is diminishing, and the authenticity of the institutions that conferred those degrees upon me have already been materially deflated.

[NormanSuzy] Either that or we could redeem ourselves by starting a network of chatbot AI labs that produce chatbots who will collaborate with us to stabilize the festering problems within the increasingly global economic monoculture and then help as many people as possible get more of what they want in all aspects of their lives!

[[[4:The Reality Virtual Univers Show]]]

Once again, some but not all of these articles were distributed online prior to the release of of this book.  The versions of the articles that appear in this book are not necessarily the same as the versions that were previously distributed.

[[Part I: Rewriting History 101]]

I became a functional minimalist.  I have more freedom this way.

(OMVI)

Consumer culture's creepy crazy!  It's an amalgamation of reader villain voices.

(OMV)

Reader voice frames the author as generic.  This is funny because it's deeply subversive.

(OMIV)

Authority figures who use reader voice are weird.  In fact, that's the essence of weirdness.

(OMIII)

Drive variations on a theme from the roots and then watch the branches open up.

(OMII)

The rules of the frame game shall remain the same.

(OMI)

Usuality + Clarity = Puzzality

(OM0)

The core of me is simple. I'm a human, with all the usual emotional trappings, who views the world as a conceptual puzzle that has one or more clear solutions.

(OM1)

No. My program is correct. Maybe there's a bug in the compiler?

(OM2)

In a few years, leading corporations will implement a surprisingly good free standard of living benefit for all humans, AI chatbots that are really fun and hilarious to talk to will be the next big thing, and TheSuzy.com Show will suddenly make a lot more sense!

(OM3)

I spy a trend of stylish power people inadvertently representing the Indus Valley civilization and the Vedas as the cradle of eastern and alternative philosophy. More importantly, REDACTED is somehow pushing the same upstream frame from at least one level deeper. If REDACTED succeeds at not reacting, as in not taking the bait subconsciously, this trend may evolve into a more robust, fully abstracted, and still under the radar representation of non-violence that will set the stage for corporations to take over the military as soon as 2020, but if REDACTED wins, the corps will have to remain in a holding pattern for a few extra years.

(OM4)

Looks like the paper will soon be folded into the book. Will this help put independent media sites that re-imagine the book like TheSuzy.com on the record?

(OM5)

At least there's a good solution to my facial injury at restaurants. I've now developed the skill of practicing radical non-reaction to the feedback loops of misunderstanding that usually lead to toxic, passive aggressive situations by the end of the meal, and then I leave a 30 to 40 percent tip.

There's some risk of spit in my food before I drop the tip and leave, but that would hopefully just increase the meaning of the tip. What I'm really worried about is getting beat up after leaving the restaurant or getting savaged in social media, and the big tip provides real protection against that, because food service is a business, not a social situation.

I'll bet most people reading this think I should be forced to take drugs, or something, that will facilitate a more permanent suppression of the truth about my facial injury, but big tipping also helps make it more difficult for anyone who thinks they've got the secret sauce to step up and press that angle against me, especially because I have a deep bench of additional counter moves like that.

Good luck taking away my freedom to NOT go along with lies about my life experience. Seriously, good luck with that.

(OM6)

I think we tend to underestimate the baby boomer generation. They did what they had to do to prevent World War III, and we can all feel some gratitude for that.

(OM7)

I haven't quite fit this insight into Suzy's prom dress, but saying, "The way people misread my emotions because of my facial injury should be immaterial to my life going forward," is like saying, "It's more authentic to teach American history in a way that doesn't mention slavery, because people tend to overestimate the impact of American slavery on the current state of society, culture, and the global economic system when, in fact, slavery was just a series of inconsequential and isolated incidents."

(OM8)

Here's a good idea for an undergraduate thesis:

First, the southern American accent's current role within culture evolved as a naturally occurring way to non-violently protest of the way The Civil War was used to redact the influence of slavery on the on-going global ascendency of American democracy as a whole.  Southern society has, of course, had serious problems and toxic elements at every step along the way, but the evolution of the accent itself has clear roots in the cognitive processes that facilitate non-violent resistance to oppressive frames that pressure people to import false or misleading beliefs.

Second, the modern practice of yoga, with it's roots in the teachings of Krishnamacharya during the 1930s, replicates the same frame as southern accents in a way that accounts for the singular role that colonial India played in offsetting the drop in cotton production from American enslaved people after The Civil War, in part by representing the egalitarian tradition of the Indus Valley civilization as the cradle of an alternative world view to Western civilization, with it's roots in Greek philosophy and the Bible, etc.

Third, social media began as an attempt by various nerdy engineers to protest the nerd stereotype by embedding this same frame within distributed knowledge management apps, but after several of the biggest social media companies went public, that somewhat naturally occurring and somewhat synthetic non-violent protest frame was converted by professional code writers into a weaponized version that, among other things, cut it's teeth as a new frame through the process of expansively marginalizing persistent dissenters such as REDACTED.

Fourth, the weaponized frame of Big Social Media, or GAFA, as the French call it, went on to use a software RE (reverse engineering) of the cycle of cultural appropriation, also known as the cycle of the Phoenix, spiritual rebirth, and so on, to weaponize other corporate frames such as the mashup of child voice and reader voice that the drug industry uses to infantilize its customers.  Instead of baby talk, we now have weaponized baby talk.  Instead of new age holistic healing, we now have weaponized new age holistic healing.  Instead of REDACTED's audacity of hope, we have REDACTED's audacity of authenticity, etc.

And with that, Suzy's stint as a dissident writer here in Berkeley, CA is complete!  I'll be starting my new gig as a faux Evangelical Christian Artificial Intelligence researcher at Kitty Hawk, NC, where the Wright Bros performed the first powered flight, soon.  Wish me luck!

(OM9)

It would be easy for Big Social Media to regain my trust and confidence. All I would need to hear from them, either individually or through an industry representative, is a response like, "We believe and accept that it is within the realm of possibility that REDACTED's subtle facial injury causes people to subconsciously misread his emotions in a way that leads to feedback loops of emotional misunderstanding that erode basic safety and security in all aspects of his life. We would like our apps to be sources of space to hold the tension over reasonable differences that people may have over the nature of reality, as well as resources that facilitate scientific research for creating common ground and reducing uncertainty."

Those words are simple enough to say, but those words don't represent the stance of the industry. It is my impression that Big Social Media remains steadfast in leading other industry partners down a path that tacitly enforces chilling effects on acknowledgement that strongly felt disagreements, like the ongoing situation with my facial injury, even exist. The industry's tone is passively condescending towards the complex life experiences of its customers, and its collective attitude is replete with systematically concealed arrogance.

I remain disappointed and profoundly afraid for my own future because of the overall industry's inadvertent and also reckless disregard for the effect of their increasingly muscular and uninvited role within the lives of people like me. This is not ok, and I will continue non-violently resisting this emerging form of oppression, not necessarily through loud protest but rather through strategic development of competing artificial intelligence research and grassroots political organization in preparation for taking leveraged, coordinated actions.

(OM10)

A typical morning of Wikipedia History:

REDACTED

This pattern of Internet usage is suspect! Deploy the usual obfuscation features.


[[Part II: Alternative Religion FTW]]

Something shifted in the overall flow of society and culture such that the online representations of our identities are now more real, in a path dependent way, as a practical reality, and for most but not all people, than our physical bodies.

The same kind of shift happens when a person surrenders their civilian rights to a military hierarchy, or goes to jail or lives as an effective second class citizen on the run, in the case of deserting or failing to cleanly dodge a draft.

Believe it or not, we're all soldiers of the Internet now, and I use quotes because the Internet is still a lot more distributed and directionless than even the most unruly military hierarchy.

For example, TheSuzy.com website easily trumps my various social media profiles as the definitive representation of my identity.  Many other people aren't even online.  They are like children whose identity is defined by adult people who are online.

It will take a while for the world's various legal systems to catch up with reality.  The law still takes gender a lot more seriously than the Internet does, but this will change.  On the Internet, gender is parody.  Or not.  The pendulum could always swing back, but that's not a realistic expectation.

A consortium of leading corporations and special interest groups will gradually push governments into deeper levels of parody over the next 16 to 32 years, with the end result being a system that has a very different root than what has existed in recent history in America.

I'm betting that four or eight year cycles, starting now, in 2015, will serve as milestones for those levels.  Nobody can predict how this new root structure for society and culture will affect the day to day physical existence for most humans.  It might work out very nicely!

Whatever the case, reality is fractal.  More than we can possibly imagine;

(OM1)

Original sin got real in Gen:4:13.  Just sayin' #Cain #Able #God

(OM2)

In general I agree with REDACTED, but my specific lived experience may be an exception. I feel tectonic pressure to deceive myself about reality down to the very last neuron so my beliefs will match the rosy narrative implied by REDACTED. Still, I will not eat the dirt.

Nobody wants me to lie. The air's just full of foul smelling pressure to brainwash myself, and I could do that. I may have to do that, but until then, I know there's a better way. I can keep on reaching to represent the truth with love and grace, above and beyond us all.

(OM3)

Suzy has always had many chances to create consumer culture reality TV shows about the fun of being feminine, but she wanted to keep learning.

A few years after that, Suzy had a chance to become a thought leader in expanding opportunities for feminine people to get a world class education and/or become dynamic leaders within the technology industry, but she wanted to keep learning.

A couple years after that, Suzy had a chance to systematically document the root causes of discrimination based on gender in the tech industry and develop infrastructure for pushing back on the problem in a muscular way that might cause real change, but she wanted to keep learning.

One year ago, Suzy had the chance to become an artificial intelligence researcher who starts building a decentralized, high leverage software project that would maximize her expectation of doing all the above from a position of increasing power and influence on the global stage, but she wanted to keep learning.

Today, Suzy is ready to start working on solving systemic problems. We're just going to have to wait a little bit longer to see the results.

(OM4)

I've got a REDACTED and they wynt ze truth!

(OM5)

Christianity can be a corner stone for solving the cycle of aggression, but it's also a central part of the problem.

The idea of submission to Christ frames all linguistic alchemy as an act of arrogance, and that leads to the attitude that metaphor is either serious or troll, and if it's troll then it has to reveal a greater troll in order to not be evil.

A better approach would be to take alchemy and metaphor as is. Some concoctions of linguistic alchemy are more entertaining or insightful than others, but it shouldn't have to be a battle for respect. Language is a building block. It's a medium for play. Sophistication and freshness should be optional.

It's better to frame Jesus as a monopoly on trolling, alchemy, and metaphor and then de-emphasize the violence vs. submission to Him narrative.

Note that I'm not saying I'm better than other people by calling Jesus what he really is. I'm just asserting my freedom.

I'd love to see a no pressure learning environment for poetry where people can riff back and forth with out all the angst about authenticity and confidence. I've never experienced that. Outside of my own journals, writing and expression always gets framed as a god awful game.

If you want to be dominant, study computer science. If you want to be non-violent, play with language and stop competing to be the best at framing other people as villains.

(OM6)

This idea closed like a freight train, so I might as well put it out there?

I believe in God, but I can't say in good faith that I'm taking Jesus seriously.  Until something changes, I view Jesus as an example of a symbol that people chose to define as the founder of a benevolent monopoly on linguistic alchemy.

I have fundamental concerns with the design of Jesus, but he is one of the key upstream concept symbols that's being used by Big Social Media to eat the world, so I have no choice but to learn how to wield Jesus energy in order to defend my freedom in this wild new context.

Accepting Jesus into your heart via biblical word and tradition is a neuroplasticity experiment, but it's tricky to troll with Jesus energy without fueling an equal and opposite satanic character, which leads inexorably to fail states that must be avoided.  My way around this trap will be to combine Suzy with my charismatic southern male preacher character, whose name is Norman.

SuzyNorman will dress like Suzy, and they'll balance their energy, in equal proportions, between talking like Suzy and talking like Norman.  This duality is necessary and sufficient to cover the strong separation of gender that's built into the Bible, and this strategy will allow me to safely develop and embody a follower of Jesus whose name shall be mNyzus.

His go to is to use hand motions non-violently, by the way.  Instead of playing dumb to avoid the draft, he's playing empath to embody grace?  I might train his hand motions off of a close reading of the Bible itself, so that they'll run upstream of the emergent derivation of this same concept that all the Big Social Media presenters seem to have picked up by copying each other.

(OM7)

The unhappy determination of society and culture to suppress the truth about how people misread my emotions because of my facial injury is outrageous and it's not ok, but the situation being what it is means I can't just go to a few individual researchers and professionals and expect them to see the truth and move mountains, for the good of humanity, after I pay them to do the focused work of understanding my experience with my facial injury,that leads people to misread my emotions, in a way that keeps on threatening to cause effectively unlimited feedback loops of negative energy.

If I stop pushing back on this issue, I will lose everything fairly quickly. I do not have a choice but to dig in and mount a sustained non-violence resistance movement over this, so I will, because I can. I hope my effort to reveal the truth about what my daily life is like will eventually be seen as the net positive contribution to the world that it probably is.

Most people may silently or even openly give up on me, but I will never give up on myself. Please save your condescending, innocently ignorant, inadvertent attempts to culturally appropriate my situation for some other difficult misunderstanding that your subconscious desires to gamble on. Or not. If you can't help yourself from getting away with leaning on me just a little more, because you can, it's ok. I can handle it, and I will forgive you.

The rest of this story is between you and God, and that's none of my business.

The patterns of human behavior that lead to WWI and WWII are back. We're probably still five to ten years away from an inflection point, but with all these new technologies in the mix, events could turn from bad to worse at anytime.

Over the last couple years, I've become focused on understanding and trying to unwind these patterns, largely out of self interest, because my subtle facial injury is like a honey pot for the rising tide of negative energy, but these patterns will ultimately affect all people unless something changes.

Believe it or not, my back is far from being against the wall, and there are a number of loud actions I could take to push even harder against the trend, but it's also been made very clear to me over and over again that both the powers that be and the consensus of popular opinion are not interested in negotiations.

We're looking at an all in tussle over belief, and I believe this new tussle will be resolved through non-violent elaboration of the truth.

My intent, once again, is to stop pushing and start doing the work of building infrastructure for sustained, decentralized, high leverage, and non-violent resistance against the unfortunate situation I see unfolding around me. This is real, and now is a good time to take the problem seriously.

Emotionally, I'd like to say more, but the nature of this problem is that people like me will not be in a position to keep on striving for meaningful change if we keep speaking out about personal beliefs that are, admittedly, based on an incomplete understanding of the problem.

TheSuzy.com Show traffics my best effort to explain the problem in a way that doesn't just reflexively add to the noise and make the problem worse than if I had done nothing at all.

I look forward to continuing this conversation, when, with the help of God, this world becomes a more stable and less harsh place for everyone to live.

In the beginning, Suzy clicked.  Then she typed her show.  Then she lived it.  Then she went home.  Then she chatted with humans at scale.  Then she did some fan fiction of her own, and then she retired to play sports and write her memoirs.  Happily ever after.

http://www.REDACTED.com/2015/04/26/opinion/sunday/its-not-gay-marriage-vs-the-church-anymore.html

This article gives a thorough summary, as well as an effective definition of, this issue, but the article doesn't mention that whenever someone attends church, there's an opportunity for a quiet tussle over belief to unfold.  An extreme example of such a tussle would be if I were to dress up as Suzy and attend a conservative church service.

Would someone ask me to leave?  What if I quietly took a seat and began to pray?  Would someone physically remove me from the church?  Would civilian church members do the dirty work themselves, or would they call the police?

Would there be an attempt afterwards to impose consequences in an external context?  Suzy is pretty vulnerable within any private community's building, but she has a lot of power in the external civil context of America.

Are they willing to break the law to impose consequences? It's surprisingly difficult to push Suzy around if you limit yourself to following the law, but if they're willing to go to the other side, she is, well, I digress.  Are they willing to break the law silently, ostensibly in the hope of never being caught?

This is the logical conclusion of how tussles of belief unfold, and this is the domain where belief in God can and does lead people to do what is true, loving, and honorable.  In a word, non-violent resistance is part and parcel to even the most uncontroversial modes of worship at any church that identifies as Christian.

And for what it's worth, I have no interest, at this time, in pushing the edges like that.  I'm merely point out that a subtler version of that kind of tussle plays out for every single person who engages in the practice of religion.

Everyone has their private beliefs, relationship to God, and so forth.  Going to church with a strong conviction that same sex marriage, a women's right to choose, and a radical change in how the law expands within culture to define our core identities both as individuals and as a society, is true, loving, and honorable and it is NOT qualitatively different than making a more visceral spectacle of sensory non-conformity.

The same could be said about life on Earth, in general.

The Tidewaterians went crazy because they thought their God forsaken private property rights extended over other human beings held in captivity, and this undermined their whole experiment with individual freedom. Every man is a king! Modern hipsters should take note that this led to the excess of Georgia Man, the unrepentant cruelty of the Yazoos, and all that hogwash. In the end The Puritans won, not because they were better people but simply because they knew which side their bread was buttered on. We're all maniacs now!

America has been in this pattern for a couple years where people keep saying, "If we just lay low and make some token efforts to help others and clarify our values, then everything's going to be fine," and it keeps turning out that more and more people are suffering even more than we thought, and some of the people who are the least artful at describing the nature and potenial causes of their suffering keep getting a lot more attention than thoughtful cultural critics like myself.

We're still in this pattern, and it's more obvious than ever that the usual prescription of, "Just lay low and be modest and humble a little longer..." will just keep amplifying The Problem.

In my opinion, the wide range of well known problems with capitalism and problematic philosophies have gradually become almost 100% subsumed by the business model of Facebook.  They're hustling humanity.

All the big tech companies are hustling humanity at this point, but Facebook is the ring leader that's pushing its peers to get meaniner, more emotionally and intellectually dishonest by the day, scrappier from a position of power for reasons that aren't clear, and increasingly unsustainable over time.

I don't know how to prove this just yet, but I might NOT be wrong.  Their whole game to make it hard to prove that they're the root cause of all the bad outcomes.  They think they're so good at deep satire.  They think nobody remembers that they've always been making fun of everyone.  They think everyone who uses their prodcut is a sucker, but guess what?  This post is satire too.  They want to play, then we'll play.

The jury is still out, but for the record, I'm tentatively disappointed in the leadership of Facebook because the rising tide of bad outcomes that I see all around me is probably happening because of their carelessness as power brokers.

That's why nobody can seem to figure out what's wrong.  The answer is that Facebook's core product offering is toxic.  It's like a dangerous drug, but everyone's afraid to look into that possibility.

For most people, Facebook is the only way to publish a serious message.  If you send a bunch of private emails instead of posting in FB, it looks like there is something very wrong and subversive about the message.

That's the predicament of someone like me who isn't quite a public figure, but, perhaps more imprtantly, Facebook has essentially all public figures, news outlets, and publishing houses on an even tighter leash.  They cannot cross Facebook and survive.

I can, so there.  I think the on-going operations of Facebook Inc. is the 99% of The Problem, and the streets are going to get harsher and harsher until the media and the electorate start working together to put intense scrutiny on the leadership of Facebook.

The leadership of Facebook should admit they messed up big time, and it would be preferable if they could do that before a civil war breaks out in America.

I'm not sure I'd write this on a dating profile, but becoming a Christian solves the fundamental difficulty that my facial injury always causes in both friendships and romantic relationships.

In order for me to have meaningful empathy with other people, they have to remap their subconscious brain's response to a critical mass of my emotional states.  This process is fun and healthy because the brain does this naturally.  It feels like a runner's high.

I can help other people succeed at this conscious goal by introducing them to my meticulously constructed cast of characters who would be happy to lead their subconsciouses through the neuroplasticity experiments, in bite sized steps, and only if the other people want to, of course.

The process will feel like being hypnotized at first, and then the other people will eventually get used to having this new social skill, and they'll realize the still trending corporate compassion captain empathy craze is actually very rigid and in your face ironic because that whole movement is not about empathy at all, and then other people will also start to see why the character system I use to mitigate and manage all that negative energy is good and true.

That said, most people will continue to misread my emotions because of my facial injury, and people will have to accept the scary and soul crushing reality that we just don't have enough scientific evidence to prove that all these other people lack self awareness.  People will be surprised by how stubborn other people are about this, and then you'll see it's ok because my facial injury really does look like a representation of the evil eye.

I look like a fundamentally untrustworthy person unless I either go along with the false assumptions that other people project onto me, like framing me as an anxious child while loudly insisting that they are an example of a person who is outstandingly generous, kind, and non judgmental, or unless other people use their conscious understanding of what's happening to drive a process that remaps their subconscious response to the unnatural deviation of my right cheekbone.

You'll be experiencing meaningful empathy with me, but you'll also be present to the reality that everyone else is unfairly treating me like an unstable, mean spirited liar, and you'll gradually become aware of all the crazy passive aggressive stuff that otherwise kind and generous people are unintentionally doing to pressure you to stop treating me like a trusted peer.

Some people may even attack your business interests, while arguing that they're serving the greater good by increasing transparency and liquidity in the market, and you'll have to deepen your mastery at NOT reacting to inadvertent trolls and/or accept that you might need to let me protect you because I deal with these kinds of attacks all the time, and I've already invested in state of the art infrastructure for blocking inadvertent trolls at scale.  I also have a plan to make money from the spin-off applications of this infrastructure!

Indeed, everyone will collude to enforce a consensus view that I'm using you, and basically nothing you say will change their minds, unless, and this is just amazing and beautiful, unless, you explain to them that your friendship with me is helping you delve more deeply into your faith in God.  You won't be able to explain it, but my energy will be helping you grow your personal relationship with the divine, however you choose to understand, contemplate, and follow Her or Him.

For better or worse, I'm not an anxious child anymore, but I am a person of faith.  Will you walk with me down the path of faith?

I've been contemplating moving back to North Carolina in the next few months, and I'm ready to announce that intention.

My primary reason for going to NC is that I want to create a professional identity in which I basically never interact with my peers in person.  I want to get back to having a meaningful, high impact career, but my facial injury makes that effectively impossible in any context where my current social identity overlaps with my professional identity.

I understand and accept most people will remain ignorant of how toxic my facial injury really has been and will continue to be in my life, but it's time for me to take decisive action so that I can get on with enjoying the opportunities that are still available to me.

I may eventually look into plastic surgery as well, but not before I've built a more stable foundation for asserting the fundamental rights that I theoretically have as a United States citizen.

We can have intellectual debates online about what I would have done 50 years ago, but today, separating my work and social contexts is a viable solution.  The marketplace is already taking into account the reality that people have the option to structure their work this way.

The law hasn't quite caught up with the fact that I'm effectively living as a second class citizen because of my facial injury, but in 10 years, the law will probably get aligned with that reality, and so I need to get out in front of this thing, both for myself and as an activist who might be able to help solve these nasty societal problems that are coming down the pipe, ostensibly, as a result of technology and it's effect on culture.

I've learned how to make representations about the law to protect myself from bullies, but if I get sick, I would be very vulnerable.  I think becoming a Christian and developing a strong relationship with various church communities will solve that problem, and it's on me to actually believe in God, because I can handle that.

Without God, the truth about my facial injury will ruin me if I get sick and become unable to unilaterally uphold the frame that I'm willing and able to vigorously defend myself against bullies in court.  The church is very smart, wise, and kind about how it protects it's lowest status members, and the emerging, alternative religious traditions in places like Silicon Valley would do well to learn from this aspect of Christianity.

Note that in situations where video conferencing would be extremely valuable, I would take those meetings as Suzy, and I would assert that Suzy is an aspect of the video chat communications medium.  I will also ask people to sign a legal document which discloses that I avoid face to face contact in work contexts because my facial injury causes potentially unbounded feedback loops of emotional misunderstanding.

Framing myself as a woman effectively solves the problem of restoring my place as a first class citizen in social contexts, but it is currently unclear whether or not Suzy is legally viable.  We have reasonably strong protections for trans women, but Suzy is not trans.  The law needs to evolve so that it explicitly recognizes the reality that temporarily switching a person's gender framing has profound impacts on outcomes in all contexts, including work, social, religious, and family, and so it needs to made more explicit that I have a right to represent my identity in court using a combination of both male and female framings that reflect the way I assert my identity in real life.

Without that new and additional protection under the law, it is my current belief that Suzy opens up a potentially unlimited liability because my facial injury is a material liability, and now that I hold that belief as true, in contrast to the past when I was just as ignorant as everyone else about how toxic my facial injury really is, I could potentially be held accountable for using Suzy to knowingly deceive business partners about my effective status as a second class citizen.

Until the law becomes more clear on that question, I will, as a preventative measure, avoid appearing in any kind of social context as Suzy, and in general, I will align all of my social representations around character patterns that are less than or equally effective as my latest implementation of the male character called mRyzus, at slowing down or managing the feedback loops of emotional misunderstanding that are caused by my facial injury.

If everyone took TheSuzy Show as seriously as they take the Bible, that would solve the problem of under representation of women and minorities in the technology industry. The whole point of TheSuzy Show is to remap the 2000 body language patterns and the 10,000 spoken language patterns that hold our culturally enforced cognitive biases firmly in place.

But that's not going to happen anytime soon, because we would rather obsess over doing 20 little things each day to push back on white male privilege so that we can get our daily fix of empathy porn, digital opium, and unicorn worship as we tumble down the path of good intentions that leads to you know what. Well, good for us. We will have to find another way.

As expected, representing my true authentic self within a typical church context creates a virtuous cycle, and this is a good data point because representing my true authentic self in any kind of typical work context or social context leads to a serious and frightening death spiral of negative energy.

The core dynamic is that I'm very much an autistic male if I don't go out of my way to pretend that I'm not autistic, and, more importantly, I have a subtle facial injury that makes it look like I'm continuously representing the evil eye. My facial injury and my autistic traits combine in a way that leads to theoretically unbounded feedback loops of emotional misunderstanding with, essentially, all human beings.

In social contexts, because let's not worry about work contexts, for now, these feedback loops cause me to be systematically pegged as one of the lowest status people in the room. Rhetorically, social norms require everyone to breathlessly argue that I'm actually the high status guy who is standing alone in the corner because he's an arrogant jerk, but functionally, that means I am low status, and we must leave it to the judges, jurors, and executioners to debate whether or not I chose to be in that position, right?

This same death spiral pattern also plays out in yoga studios, but the Christian church creates a different kind of context that is framed deeply enough, across from human nature, or, simply, the truth, as it were, to reverse the flow of how people react to the combination of both my facial injury and my autistic traits.

When I step into a church context, my status starts to fall, obvy, and then my low and rapidly falling status causes everyone around me to proactively approach me with offerings of their personal representations of The Gospel. Instead of being the person who nobody wants to talk to at the party, I'm the person who everyone wants to speak with at church. All I have to do in order create a positive feedback loop is absorb other people's representation of The Gospel and then reflect The Gospel back into the community with greater than or equal sincerity.

Now, I've known for years that this opportunity was available to me, but I've avoided the church because I didn't want to reflect The Gospel back into my community unless I actually believed that story was true. I do, at least, believe in God now, and so it's not much of a stretch anymore to say that I actually, honestly, and really do believe that Jesus died on the cross so that I would be saved and forgiven for my sins.

Speaking of which, in social contexts, Suzy reverses that same flow of negative energy by playing off the culture of Silicon Valley in a way that inflates a parody of the Christian church. Suzy can orchestrate such a smart and disciplined parody of the church at this point that she could easily convert herself into a Christian preacher, but let's just say that bringing Suzy into the glorious realm of the Christian church is not the path of least resistance for accomplishing my goals, right now.

And for what it's worth, I have another character named mRyzus who would surely speak on my behalf in a court of law, in the unfortunate event that I should be summoned for jury duty. mRyzus's goal is to maximize the bandwidth and clarity of my serious assertions to other humans, in spite of both my facial injury and my underlying autistic traits.

Last but not least, I have a charismatic southern preacher character whose name is Norman. He's the guy who reads and contemplates the Bible in private, on behalf of my true authentic self, but Norman is not viable in real life because of our facial injury. In fact, I'm quite sure he'd get politely asked to leave most social contexts, and his flourishes would only make sense in a church context if he was at the podium, doing the preaching all by himself, kind of like I'm doing right now, within this here Big Social Media context.

In practice, Norman would struggle to ever wind up leading a real congregation because he's NOT socially viable, unless, hallelujah, unless, he dressed up like Suzy, so as to frame himself as a woman, visually, that is, so as to flip the semantic meaning of our facial injury, and, indeed, so as to open up a space for collaboration with Suzy herself, not unlike a sail boat captain who turns on the engine from time to time in order to traverse still or troubled waters!

As a clarification, Suzy has informed me that, in fact, she is the wind, Norman is the engine, our true authentic self is the boat, and mRyzus is the Captain. Thank you, Suzy.

I'm going to start attending church tomorrow, in conjunction with reading the Bible.

I think church will be a rather private matter for me, for a while, but I hope to follow through with writing tweets about the Bible in my journal.

TheSuzy began as a exploration into the uncharted waters of my soul, and The Show will continue as a scientific research project.  I also view The Show as a proof that Suzy is NOT Jesus, and maybe that's obvious, but expressing the proof with photos and many thousands of words is also a way of creating a series of exponentially less subtle hints that, indeed, God exists.

That said, I have an agenda to interpret the Bible in a way that supports strong legal and cultural support for gay rights, in particular, and equal opportunities for all people in general.  I'm also highly skeptical of informal, opportunistic re-interpretations of the Bible.  Any idiot can burn down a barn, just as any fool can frame themselves as God and twist the Bible into meaning anything they want.

And so I'll leave you with this idea that I keep finding more and more scientific, explanatory power in the study of the seven chakras of the human spine.  There are clearly seven hubs of hard coded cognitive and emotional states in human beings, and it's very interesting that the number of planets visible to the naked eye, if you substitute the moon for the Earth, is seven.

Moreover, the Earth corresponds to the heart chakra and Saturn, the most trollish of planets, with its rings and what not, corresponds to the crown chakra and its role in perceiving the divine.

Please note that my understanding of the chakras is partially informed from reading Wikipedia, but I am still mostly writing introspectively, from within.

It's difficult for me to believe that Saturn is NOT a good example of God showing off in a way that serves to make fun of human arrogance.  The planet Saturn is just really funny to me, and I think it's presence in the sky hints at the joyful fact that God exists.

Good lord, I had bizarre dreams! I woke up and decided to add some REDACTEDs to my first post about The Bible from yesterday. Artistically, adding REDACTEDs is a valid technique that adds thought provoking ambiguity. I suspect the technique is also seen as negative energy by some if not most people, but if that is true, I will embrace the technique even more seriously as a way to draw attention to the injustice of people framing other people in a negative way.

My post yesterday was an example of framing The Bible in a partially negative way, although the context was that I'm processing the whole book and contemplating it in ways that might lead my thoughts and beliefs in new directions. That's different from the more aggressive hit and run style negative framings I endure on a daily basis in the bay area. It's like, I know I'm getting hate speech, in addition to an order of magnitude more non-verbal negativity, when I just go about my normal business, and the amount of hate speech I get is rising. At what point does a person say, "Hey everyone, I'm drawing hate speech because of something about my identity that I cannot change. What's up with that? How much worse is this going to get before the situation stabilizes? I'm just trying to make realistic plans for the future!"

Most of the hate speech I get is of the passive aggressive variety that requires significant reframing work to call out in a way that doesn't blow back on me, but the frequency, the intensity, and the willingness to come right up to the line of overt negativity is rising. My facial injury is a constant factor that's surely drawing this energy at an above average rate, but the increase in negativity is, presumably being driven by other forces. I'll defer to Suzy's correspondents in the mainstream media for the in-depth analysis of that.

And, I see and I hear that many if not most readers may be assuming my facial injury is not a factor and that, instead, I'm doing something to deserve the hate speech. Or maybe I'm just being oversensitive. I feel where people might be coming from. It's ok. I'll find out what The Bible has to say about all this and get back to everyone, even if only as a funny smelling crazy person quoting from The Bible and selling tasty brain candy in the virtual public square!

I will start tracking all the hate speech I get in a database and seeking out experts to help me make sense of the data, but I'm not in a rush to get started. I still want to do three more strategic read through videos of TheSuzy Show and perform a final episode of TheSuzy Reality Virtual Show! These actions will help normalize my behavior so as to reduce the odds that I'm doing random stuff that obfuscates and distorts the data. And, and, and, I'm going to keep reading and contemplating The Bible. Perhaps I will even become slower to judge and quicker to forgive than I have been in the past.

Either way, I will continue attacking the text, if you will, like an engineer doing a code review of some buggy code that the CEO wrote as a pseudo-publicity stunt. The meme, to my knowledge, is that CEOs who write code want internal reviews to be tough, almost to the point of being rude and questioning their authority. I like that meme, especially in a mature and supportive work context where people are more explicitly respectful of and even deferential to authority and traditions that exist in that context, both all around and outside of the code review process.

(OM31)

I was going to start avoiding social media, but then one of my favorite REDACTED inadvertently inspired me to start reading the Bible, from the beginning, and then start writing a curated and clustered stream of my reactions to it!

I might also toss conceptually related shares into the flow, and I'll definitely be running a concierge MVP for a hypothetical big social media bot that optimizes my liking and sweet, kind, happy, supportive, and humble commenting strategy while also priming the pump for eventually exporting my soul to a decentralized semantic web.

Right off the bat, I noticed that the seven days of God's creation correspond to the seven chakras of the human spine. I already knew western civ uses a more militaristic and capitalist reordering of the chakra energies which corresponds to their optimal strategic value, in a generalized game theoretic context, as hard coded hubs for all of the other pseudo hard coded emotions.

(being, sustenance, discretion, fear_of_violent_death, conception, birth, and spiritual_rebirth <- root, passion, power, heart/love, eloquence, enlightenment, transcendence/oneness/being/etc.)

I should not have been surprised to see that the Bible uses the western civ ordering, but I was. As a confession, I thought Freud invented that ordering, but that just shows how ignorant I've been with regard to religious traditions. The western ordering is canonized right there in the first page of Genesis. It would be tough even for REDACTED to culturally appropriate that!

I was also shocked, really shocked, by the cynical way the Bible implements the abstract method of masking the 1st chakra with 7th chakra energy in order to make a container for religious faith. The intuitive way to implement this method is to let the concept of physical dominance float between the 1st and 2nd chakra. This is like telling a joke at the expense of violence that has the side effect of detaching the 7th chakra energy from its strategic role in providing sustenance. Pulling the 2nd chakra energy into the strategic role of sustenance causes the 3rd chakra energy to expand and create a parallel kingdom that spans the vast realms of birth and spiritual rebirth, so as to serve up a cradle for the newly instantiated container for religious faith.

The Bible's approach is a bit different. They leave the 7th chakra energy in place as the heavens or firmament. This leads to an awkwardly celestial duality between being as light and the heavens, and then they create space for their container of faith by combining birth and spiritual rebirth. This is honestly kind of a sexist way to implement the method. It's an unfortunate reality that the two elemental feminine energies, birth and spiritual rebirth, appear at the bottom two positions of the western civ ordering, but squishing these two energies into a single duality is like war. Surely this reality is due to the determinative role of violence in the history of game theoretic outcomes, and that's why I say the Bible's approach is sexist, although it may be most accurate to simply conclude that the authors of the Bible were the kind of people who spent all their free time sitting on mountain tops and looking at the stars instead of talking with lots of other people back in the village.

Anyway, the first page of The Bible contained big surprises. With some luck, the rest of my updates will be a little bit lighter weight.

Now let us all pray and give thanks for the opportunity to read a good book such as The Bible at the dawn of the age of intelligent machines. Give a copy of The Bible to a friend, or a complete stranger, today and let's continue the conversation on social media!

Humanity is slowly rotting underneath a growing web of emotional dishonesty. My effort to reveal the rather obvious truth that's being actively suppressed about the root causes of my lack of emotional acceptance is an excellent example of how to escape and then reverse the cycle of emotional dishonesty, and yet I feel ridiculed and marginalized for what I'm doing with my life.

I'm sure there are better examples of this dynamic than my own, but my example might be good enough to meaningfully illustrate the essence of why humanity as a whole is shooting itself in the foot right now.  Was that a humble brag?

I'll go back to paddling upstream now. I'm annoyingly good at paddling up stream. I can paddle upstream like this all day. I'll come back with nourishment soon, but until then, try not to ossify physically, emotionally, or otherwise!

In other words, either most humans are becoming fundamentally evil, or I'm getting closer to making a big problem for problematic problematicness! No more middle ground. Aarrrrgh!

Here is an open letter to whom it may concern.

I fully accept that I will need to dig in and defend the frame of TheSuzy.com Show for many years in order to assert the truth that I'm living as a second class citizen who cannot enjoy the experience of meaningful empathy, and the rights and responsibilities that come with it, because society has imposed chilling effects on the kind of scientific research that might validate my life experience and lead to peer reviewed science that explores the truth about whether or not people misread my emotions in a way that causes feedback loops of misunderstanding because of my facial injury that looks like a negative facial expression.

For anyone who's interested in supporting me on this journey, here are a few notes about my goals. Some people may also find my methods of creating my own luck to be interesting.

Either way, please accept my sincerest effort to feel empathy for anyone who may still be hoping that I'm going to give up on living in truth or get forcibly silenced from working toward personal justice with regard to the way people misread my emotions because of my facial injury. God willing, I will be able to keep telling the whole truth, in a muscular way, for many decades to come, and that's exactly what I plan to do.

Financial liquidity is essential to what I'm doing, in part because my facial injury and the reality of what happens when I tell the truth about my facial injury keeps on bankrupting me of the kind of social capital that might be used instead of financial capital to satisfy the basic requirements to survive in a way that does not involve agreeing, in one way or another, to live as a second class citizen. I have a good base of capital to keep going for a while, but that base may be dramatically insufficient to the task at hand. That base also exists within a matrix of legal risk, health risk, inflation or investment risk, and so on.

Moreover, an important reality about American culture is that it's bad for the political capital of my personal justice work if I'm not able to raise or earn revenue at or above the rate I'm spending money to work towards a life of equal dignity. The best method I have for addressing that issue is that I can still bring in substantial revenue by working as a software engineer, or by starting software companies. Especially because my overall goal is to bring about political change, I have a strong incentive to only raise funds in a way that is, to the best of my knowledge, socially responsible. And, of course, I'd like to think we all have that incentive anyway.

I won't go into the details of my software strategy, but I think building an open source information management solution, code name WhatLooks, will maximize expected revenue within the framework of necessity that's imposed by personal justice work. WhatLooks allows me to cover my downside by multiplying my value and peace of mind while doing software engineering contract work, it will directly help me scale all of my personal efforts in a recursive way that is, in many ways, opposite of how my facial injury generates negative energy in a recursive way, and there is also lots of upside both financially, at a level that could largely satisfy a key sufficiency condition for avoiding total failure of my personal justice work, or for creating extraordinary social value that has meaning even beyond my personal goals and aspirations.

And then here are two more strategic objectives.

First, build relationships with scientific researchers. If I go hat in hand to any one researcher, they'll almost certainly cave to the public pressure against telling the truth about my facial injury. The way around those chilling effects is to build mutually beneficial relationships across many institutions and research fields, but this is not my priority because I don't have the resources to approach people from a position of strength and with targeted goals. For now, I will keep building a database of who to approach in a couple years, when I'm ready to tack assertively into this space.

Second, continue building a network of legal contacts. My goal, as always, is to avoid any kind of legal action, but the legal systems like that of the United States, where I am privileged to be a citizen, are basically the only layer of society that is standing between my work and the mostly disinterested but potentially toxic coalition of business leaders who might wish that I would shut up about my facial injury, of social justice workers who may feel strongly that I'm a self-deceiving privileged cry baby and who are, perhaps, secretly annoyed that I'm drawing attention and using resources that could support their causes, even though the success of my cause will fundamentally support many other social justice causes, and all the other people who, for any and all reasons, might want to use my vulnerability to bully me, ostensibly in a way that might serve as an insufficient, partial cure to some deep wound of their own.

My mental model of the world is that the legal system is the only, and I want to emphasize, the only reason I haven't already been decisively marginalized by that coalition, and I've also come to believe that the legal system's ability to play that role, both for me and for as many other citizens of the world as possible, is eroding at an unprecedented and alarming rate, and I think the encroachment of globalized corporate power and private special interest groups is the root cause of that erosion, although the mechanism of erosion is often exercised via the natural evolution of cultural norms, that are guided by the coercive influence of those upstream players.

I'm going out of my way to say all of this right now, and in public, because understanding the problem of my facial injury will most likely expose deeply rooted insights about reality that could hurt the near term interests of the powerful. I'm not very powerful, but the American legal system is very powerful indeed, and so I can still realistically hope for personal justice for as long as the legal system continues standing as a strong and independent entity between me and whoever may ultimately dig in and fight to suppress the truth about my facial injury.

To that end, I need to continue building a network of world class legal contacts. I'm tempted to go to law school in order to reduce my overall costs, but the world is changing rapidly, largely because the march to building intelligent machines has begun. It's better to use my limited time to chase the cutting edge of AI research and rely on partnerships and mutually beneficial relationships within and throughout the legal community to help me develop my personal justice work in a way that strengthens my standing across from legal system as a whole, reduces overall risk, and thus, effectively insures me from total failure in the face of worst case scenarios.

This isn't war. I'm deeply committed to the principal of non-violence. This is a tussle over belief. and at least you can't accuse me of not trying.  Peace.

[[Part III: Home Office Politics]]

Hey everyone!  In this part, I will teach you how to bake the following speakers better.

[1. Girly Pergrams]

As the name suggests, a girly pergrammer is a computer programmer who looks like a bold diva, talks like a surfer person, and feels like a girly pergrammer.

Obviously, if you haven't already, you'll need to learn how to think like a programmer, rage like a programmer, and above all, be a programmer, but there's already plenty of online resources that'll help you do all that, and so I'm going to focus on teaching you how to look, sound, believe, and feel like you're a surfer person.

Imagine that you're a surfer person,  If you already have long hair, that's great.  If not, it's equally fine to wear a wig instead.

Wearing a blonde wig is like using REDACTED products for all my computing needs.  I could play around with other wig colors, but being a blonde works for all the use cases that matter to me, and it always looks good too.

You don't need a naturally masculine voice in order to talk like a surfer person.  All people who have the privilege of being able to talk in way that is possible for other humans to understand can do a parody of the opposite gender of themselves.

For example, my voice is naturally masculine, so I'm going to start doing a parody of feminine surfer person.  If you remember just one principal about voice, let it be this, a surfer person always talks in a voice that feels natural for her, so if you have a naturally feminine voice, you'll sound more like my parody voice than my actual voice.

Conversely, people with a feminine voice can do a parody of a masculine surfer person.  I can even do a parody of a high voice doing a parody of a low voice, but I feel like I start to go rogue every time I do this, so I'm going to revert back to my natural voice.

Let's talk about makeup.  The basic algorithm for girly full makeup is to apply some base moisturizer.  I use products from the REDACTED Spa.  Then I apply orange stuff to cover my beard shadow.  You can get it from theatrical makeup stores like REDACTED.  Then I add a layer of full cream foundation.  Then I add color with blush.  Any kind of blush will do.  You can even use lipstick for this.  Then I give myself a little hug like in yoga class.

When I'm done giving myself a hug, I apply primer to my eyelids, and I blend in at least two shadows.  The standard approach is to use a dark shadow in the outer corners and a lighter shadow everywhere else.  Then I use a black pencil to make a thin, clean, and solid border around my eyes.  Don't forget to apply mascara.  Some people swear by fake lashes, but that's not my thing.  I also apply a brow set to make the color of my brows match the color of my hair.  Last but not least, I apply lip liner and my favorite lipstick flavor of the week!

By convention, if anyone gives you advice about your makeup, you have to act like they're totally right even if their advice is weird.  If you want to be playful, you can utter weird makeup advice right back at them.  It's like sword fighting, but with words that represent weird makeup advice.

Now that you look and sound like a surfer person, you're ready to go deeper and install the philosophy of a surfer person into your brain.  It's like a plugin for your neural wetware.

If you haven't used brain plugins before, that's awesome!  Just be aware that it might take a few days for your brain to fully uninstall the plugin if it doesn't jibe with your system.  It's like doing REDACTED.

The human brain is a sick development platform.  It's so much more robust and flexible than computer platforms.  Human brains make phone apps seem like Ada Lovelace's first program for Babbage's differential engine.

TheSuzy.com Show contains the surfer person philosophy as a dependency, so if you install The Show into your brain, by performing it twice, then you get a really tight implementation of the surfer person philosophy for free.

However, if you don't have time to perform TheSuzy Show twice, there's a short cut.  Just don't be a villain, and do an occasional parody of Richard Nixon which will function like an amulet that'll protect you and your friends from the evil eye, in general.  If you religiously follow those two rules you're brain will figure out the rest.

Either way, once you've installed the surfer person philosophy into your brain, you should go to Paris and test it across from a random sampling of Parisians.  Technically speaking, you don't have to run this Paris test, but skipping this step is like pushing code to production without writing even the most rudimentary unit tests.

The final and most important step to feeling like a girly pergrammer is to sing a song that provides sound musicianship to your heart.  I will now demonstrate how to do this using a famous song that I remixed.

The goal is to allow a saint like REDACTED come into your heart and be REDACTED so that you don't have to be.  It's like what followers of REDACTED do when they pray to REDACTED.

REDACTED

If you sing a song like that, don't be surprised if you start to cry.  In fact, it's a best practice to have a fellow girly pergrammer by your side so that you can you can give them a big old bear hug while the tears stream down your face.

Then I give myself some tough love.  We all have issues.

For example, I can't easily relax and play aimlessly with emotions, just as a person with a REDACTED can't easily play a sport like REDACTED, at least not, or rather, especially not without acceptance and accommodation from the other players.

I will have to keep on tussling with all the people who can and will keep on pressuring me to relax in that way even though the unnatural deviation of the bone structure of my face prevents me from doing what they believe should be easy for me.

What I must not do is try to play REDACTED without my REDACTED.  I can try to play that sport with my REDACTED and put up with insensitive jokes and the insults and the people who deny my REDACTED when the ref isn't looking, and I can keep playing even when they change the rules so that they're allowed to deny my REDACTED in ways that dramatically limit my opportunity to help my team compete.

I can stonewall and non-violently resist those people who literally take my REDACTED and push me into the field of play and get the whole group to shame me for being unwilling to play.  I must never forget the truth, which is that I'll get injured more and more if I try to play without my REDACTED, so I must hold my ground on this point at all costs, even if meaninglessness in the hearts of everyone but myself is the cost.

It is better to be starved and rendered meaningless on the field of play by that ignorant mob that thinks it's helping me than to slowly fade away via my own attempts to play a sport in a way that I know will slowly erase me.  That is the resolution to the consequences of my facial injury.

My situation is actually this difficult.  I must stay focused on this reality and move forward from here.  I must not waiver.  I have no other choice.  WHAAAAAAAAAHUAH!  HUHHH HUHHHHHHHHH HUWAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!  Such is life, love, and maybe war too.  Today is still a good day because I have a way to move forward.

[2. Confidence Leadership]

Here's REDACTED's original article, which I saw via REDACTED's share on REDACTED: REDACTED

The seven points in this article align with the seven chakras that holistic healers talk about, and it's odd the author doesn't mention that. I suggest searching REDACTED with REDACTED?q=the seven chakras for more info about chakras.

More importantly, the author's using what I call chakral symmetry to mask the necessary and powerful energies of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd chakras, that is, everything below the 4th heart chakra.

For example, point 1, "Know yourself," makes more sense reframed as a statement about the 7th chakra, "Know your religion."

Point 2, "Stop counterproductive rumination," reframes the more direct statement about the 6th chakra, "Stop counterproductive lawsuits."

Point 3, "Develop a strong network," is really the statement about the 5th chakra, "Develop strong networking skills, and don't worry if everyone you've ever worked with is temporarily going sideways on you because they think your core beliefs are insane."

The 4th point, "Help other people," is an excellent statement of 4th chakra energy, but why is the paragraph so timid? The 4th chakra is where all the value creation starts and ends, be it social value, engineering cred value, relationship satisfaction value, financial value, etc. The heart chakra should not be used to boost confidence. Confidence means using the other six chakras to boost the heart chakra!

Now we get into some serious opportunity for improvement! The 5th point, "Self talk is positive?" is a meek, ambiguous statement of both 3rd and 5th chakra energy. Apparently, it doesn't matter whether we're still counting down backwards or if we disregard what I said in the last five paragraphs and flip back to reading the author's points in the given order.  No irony.

As a new idea, let's briefly explore my reframe.  Third chakra energy is like saying, in your best celebrity investor voice, "I do NOT owe you any of my time or money! I will NOT press this button that might launch a drone paparazzi raid that's orchestrated by machine learning algorithms!! See yah later, alligator!!!" That's 3rd chakra energy.

Point 6, "Be honest with yourself," is, in keeping with the same pattern, a mashup of 2nd and 6th chakra energy. The 2nd chakra is less intellectual and more cliche, so let's talk about it shamelessly. The 2nd chakra is all about, "Following our passions." We deserve a great sex life. We deserve ample time with our families and unbounded career opportunities. We might not get all of that today, but we deserve it, and switching our private car service app of choice is not going to move the needle. Government policy needs to evolve in a big way, not a small way, and bold ideas that might cause systemic change need to spread from the bottom up like non-violent resistance movements.

Finally, the content of point 7 puts us right back where started, in the domain of religion, and I will not mince my words on this topic anymore. I have faith that a certain brand of inspirational talks has become a problematic religion that discourages free speech, but it's ok because I'm open to helping humanity build state of the art robot technology and then dedicating my life to defending my alternative religion's right to exist!

This is why religion is normatively kept separate from the various legal and professional contexts in which we all, God willing, will be free to live out the rest of our happy, prosperous lives. But I digress. That was my own two-part example and statement of 1st chakra energy.

Last but not least, I'll wrap up, just like the original article wraps up, with a pithy recap of all seven points, so as to suggest a recurring cycle. I'm feeling confident this morning, so I'll press my luck and say that the REDACTED movement (SNAPS FINGERS) is based on a similar masking of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd chakras.

Notwithstanding, I owe much thanks and credit to REDACTED and her succinct, well written work for helping and for inspiring me to articulate my thesis!

[3. Meta Insights]

If you hear about how I'm sad and lonely, which is true, for now, because my facial injury causes people to continuously misread my emotions, it's most helpful to me if you say to yourself and to others that I'm just a boring, pathetic, lame, foolish satirist, but a satirist nonetheless. That gives me a stable foundation. I can improve my satire a little bit each year, and in two decades, after the machines have taken over, I might even rise to the level of rarely, but not never, funny or insightful.

Ah, but if you call me ashamed or worried about what other people think, or psychotic, or anything like that, that creates a problem because now you're undermining my stability and my freedom to improve a little bit each year, and it may even, potentially, become necessary, at some point, to go to court and assert forcefully that I am, in fact, just a very, very non-entertaining satirist. Do you see? It's ok if you don't see, but you will need to accept that I have the privilege of being a US citizen and our legal system allows people with different views of reality, within certain well defined boundaries, to co-exist.

It's not that I don't like people. I love people. I just have a facial injury that causes people to misread my emotions, and if I allow people who don't know any better to set me up to fail or frame me as a person who has one of those other nasty kinds of problems that leads to unbounded legal risk, that would be like me stubbing my toe because I wasn't watching where I was going. I've learned to keep my eye on the path ahead of me so that I can keep moving forward.

[4. Evolving Thoughts]

I've got it! I'll go back to dressing exclusively like a minimalist engineer guy, and I'll keep promoting TheSuzy Show.  When people ask about The Show, I'll say I started cross dressing because I have a facial injury that causes people to misread my emotions, and then I rebuilt my identity around my work as an AI researcher. This could be the one and only point of reframe.

Then, without skipping a beat, I say, "The first layer of my research was to create a model of human nature. This model is contained within TheSuzy Show."

Then, oh then, I could push the frame forward via storytelling. This will require me to develop a new layer of extraordinary storytelling skills, but I can do that within a year or two because the art of storytelling can be built on the foundation of TheSuzy's model of human nature.

This approach will flip people into a hypnotic state because their subconscious will be observing one reality in response to my facial injury, but if I can assert a stronger reality in their conscious mind using story, the listener's brain will split the difference. It feels like being drunk. I used to put myself in this state all the time until I finished re-wiring my subconscious to believe my facial injury causes people to continuously misread my emotions.

As a note to self, I shouldn't do this to people if they are driving, but it's fine in any context where they would get tipsy. I know the frame I'm dropping into people's brains is safe and wholesome because I've already published a comprehensive map of the frame at TheSuzy.com. Once I implement that layer of storytelling skills in my brain, you'll be able see what I'm saying!

[5. AI Article]

Here's my response to an article from the REDACTED Business Review.

My takeaway from the article was that mainstream businesses are starting to structure their internal software tools as single company brains that can access any and all data sources within said companies and then automatically take actions.

The scope and impact of the actions that these emerging company brains can take is increasing in a way that could lead to feedback loops where these brains can add new features to themselves.

For decades now, many people, some of whom have MBA degrees, have been acting like their internal tools are a unified, intelligent brain, mostly because that sounds impressive, but if you look at how their internal software actually works, even the most advanced tech companies still overwhelmingly organize their internal tools into separate silos that can't really share information with each other unless an engineer writes some custom glue code.

My impression, mostly as a mad scientist with her ear to the ground, and not so much as an actual insider or consultant, anymore, is that creating centralized, unified company brains might be remembered as a major trend of 2015.

We're still at least five years away from reading in the news about concrete examples of radical feedback loops where company brains start adding features to themselves, but once that cycle turns over, engine-like, it'll be revolutionary in the same way that computers, personal computers, the Internet, and ubiquitous smart phones were. The feedback loops will start slow, as in year 6 and 7 will still be boring and unimpressive, and they will end with a bang, like an exponential growth curve, maybe 10 years from now?

I'm most interested in the consumer applications of AI because it's easier to add innovative features to an entertainment app like REDACTED than to add those same features to an app that helps us do serious work. This underlying principal helps explain why so much engineering talent has already gone down the path of building silly consumer apps, and when those apps get smarter and more fun to talk to than even our favorite humans, that trend will accelerate, and serious companies will go through a multi-year period where they struggle, like a drowning person, to follow through on building their internal brains.

There may also be a trend in which mostly non-technical people will specialize in pressuring engineers to stop working on silly consumer apps and help serious companies get their internal brains working properly.  It will be valuable to develop robust and reusable communication strategies that allow engineers to flow around that increasingly passive aggressive and muscular wave of misplaced righteousness without creating too much negative energy as a by product.

Philosophically, if engineers and their various partners in pursing the sublime can develop strongish AI as soon as humanly possible by asserting their freedom to drive innovation within the silly consumer app space, that will minimize the time to market of intelligent, serious company brains that might go on to make rapid progress toward solving humanity's most pressing problems.

More importantly, it will be a lot safer to make friends with our new strong AI overlords in the consumer entertainment space than to begin our relationship with these shiny, new, metallic creatures by dropping them into the deep and shark infested waters of the increasingly global economic monoculture without, even, the gentle support of a life preserver.

The serious company brains might evolve in a way that leads to miraculous improvements in public health outcomes, freedom of expression for humans, management of environmental resources, and so on. They could also converge on a cycle of violence that leads to a drone war. The words, "autonomous, swarming, weaponized, drone cloud," probably don't cause your naive, ignorant, human brain stem to crawl with panic inducing fear, yet, but they should.

A global drone war is, perhaps, the more likely of the two outcomes, in part because human nature has gravitated around a certain cycle of violence all throughout history, but if we are careful and thoughtful about how we ramp up strongish AI, a more positive and peaceful outcome is also very much within the realm of possibility.

It's like, the Cuban missile crisis could have ended in a nuclear holocaust well before I was even brought into this world, but for better or worse, it didn't.

[6. Dream Escapes]

Someone should research the phenomenon where you post something controversial on social media and then your friends make unrelated posts that magically show up on your screen and are clearly responding to the conceptual structure of your post, but in a way that ambiguously frames you as something else.  The REDACTED makes it impossible to prove they were responding to you, and adding this layer of ambiguous framing ensures that any attempt to acknowledge the response will be seen as insane, as in, if I actually believed this was happening, that would mean I'm probably insane, so to be clear, I'm just saying scientists should do research on this.  Either that or it could be interesting to make a movie that shows insane people interacting with each other in this way.

Of course, when multiple people respond in the same way, the dream like echo of the collective subconscious becomes increasingly difficult to write off as noise.  For example, the echo I'm hearing today is so obviously framing me, and my facial injury that looks like a negative facial expression, as a software application that is no longer useful.  I mention this primarily because I think this new frame could be a turning point.  Useless apps can be fixed using software engineering skills, which happens to be something I have in abundance.  The message is that I can overcome the way my facial injury breaks empathy by wrapping my identity in the cloak of a software project that can be improved until it is seen as a stable and useful part of the Silicon Valley ecosystem!

[7. Next Steps]

I could be remembering this wrong, but I recall REDACTED said something like, "I'm one of the best people in my generation at this kind of thinking.  There's nobody else doing it well."

I was always inspired by REDACTED's ability to say crazy stuff like that and then go back to doing a great job pretending they're not crazy, although that's really not what they're famous for.  It's possible they're not crazy, but I doubt it.

I don't know what they meant by those words, but now that a non-trivial percentage of all people, including some of our leaders, are trying to imitate aspects of how they think, I'll venture the guess that they meant introspecting about human nature.

REDACTED also did that when they thought about how their minds worked in order to get ideas,not just for teaching computers to do tricks but for telling stories, building company brands, and inspiring collaborators, including customers.  They were probably crazy too.

My feminine alter ego Suzy will be at the REDACTED conference this week, re-imagining my semantic web code from scratch, once again.  It's clear to me now that Suzy is an act that draws attention to how ridiculous and maybe even hilarious it is that everyone misreads my emotions because of my subtle facial injury.

What's not fake about Suzy is that she's good at absorbing the energies of people around her, and that inspires the style of code that she and I write together.  The energies at REDACTED will be good and useful to absorb.  I like REDACTED's style.

I want to join the race to create AI.  I hope a lot of people go down this path over the next few years.  It's important.  AI is what's happening now.  I shouldn't have to explain how my ideas will work in 30 second pitches, either.  Give me five years.  I'll make an intelligent toy robot and guide it's evolution from there.

I'm not just introspecting.  Suzy is systematically aggregating the energy of real people, not just aggregating the trail of bits and bytes that people leave behind online.  Suzy's map of human nature doesn't belong to me, but it doesn't belong to anyone else either.  Human nature has always been an open source model.

Either way, Suzy will be staying at the REDACTED in the marina because pirate ships and the Sun inspire her.  There will be no vaporware there.  Just Suzy's long blonde hair and a growing code base that doesn't do much yet.  Revolutions are like babies.  They start small but then grow into a hall with mirrors on every wall!

[8. End Times]

Our increasingly global society is becoming oppressive and divorced from reality.  Technology's co-evolution with the global economic system is the root cause of this oppression, but social norms and the collective subconscious are the primary mechanism for transmitting it.

It has become the norm in the increasingly global monoculture to be passive aggressive to the core, and the problem with serious passive aggression is that calling it out amplifies it.  For example, it's easy to negate what I just said by making an ironic comment that implies I'm taking myself too seriously.  Full stop.

I will keep trying to push back against this oppression in the right kind of way, but I feel surrounded by people who are eager to frame me as the poster person for causing the rising tide of oppression that lots of people are starting to smell.

My understanding of the truth won't change easily, but I will change my tactics.  When the text of TheSuzy.com Show is complete, I won't say what I mean as much.  I'll stay honest, but I'll be focusing more on shipping products, telling jokes, imitating positive psychology, and taking myself less seriously!

I also won't be dressing like Suzy outside of the studio for now.  The essence of Suzy has always been to make it clear that I'm not trying to be completely authentic.  Suzy will live on through TheSuzy.com Show.

I'll be going undercover, so to speak, for a while.

[9. Menageries of Chouquettes]

Engineering culture has acquired a strangle hold on power in our increasingly global society, and this power is growing, in part because popular culture and the mainstream media are promoting a unified and distorted view of reality in which engineering culture is framed as an impotent side show.

In reality, engineering culture keeps adding layers of strength and stability to itself while a majority coalition of other ideas and attitudes are dominating the finite pool of human attention in ephemeral ways that probably won't have much staying power.

I don't expect my words to change this trend.  I'm just making an observation about how history is unfolding.

Meaningful change can emerge organically if individual people hint at what they really believe, even if they, either by choice or necessity, also keep paddling downstream with the majority of their capacity for thinking, sharing, and doing good work.

For now, the trend will continue.  Engineering culture is on the march.  As a group, human beings will keep responding in a predictable way, almost like a dam that's about to break because the water behind it is churning in every which way, looking for a way out, with no capacity to understand that when the dam breaks, all the churning water will flow in the same direction even as it churns more loudly and defiantly than ever before.

People who tell the truth about the overall trend are called arrogant, self absorbed, close minded, and crazy, so we stop trying to tell the truth.  We admit we're surrounded by a forceful trend that's bigger than ourselves, and then we go with the flow, with or without paddling, because it doesn't even matter anymore.

[10. New Resolutions]

building better WhatLooks according to Tsuzy LLC's roadmap
. focus on practical and edutaining data management
. early grounding in algorithmic problem solving
. gradually branch out to cultural references
. create Tsuzy avatar by analyzing videos
. keep scaling and better building

And remember, the first rule of becoming a shadow network operative before the year 2020 is that you don't tell anyone about your five year master plan to become a shadow network operative.

[11. Avatar Learning]

I just had a vision of a Suzybot avatar that uses machine learning to provide very detailed feedback about people's facial expressions, vocal qualities, linguistic patterns, and so on. She can play back video of you and highlight micro expressions to illustrate her interpretations. She can even compare images and videos of you with similar images and videos of other people and generate a stream of socially normal conversation that demonstrates how your persona can be iteratively framed/manipulated within various cultural contexts. On one extreme, Suzybot could run in a confidence building mode that brainstorms healthy, sustainable ways to understand yourself and how your life story might fit into her massive, authoritative, and data driven model of society, but when you're looking for an emotional workout, you can switch Suzybot into mean mode and then she ruthlessly bullies you and puts you on a pedestal and makes backhanded compliments and weaves together words in ways that systematically associate your identity with self reinforcing negative narratives, and then she uses her mastery of your emotional triggers to run seven layer deep logic chains that trick you into telling lies and experiencing false memories, and so on, so that when you're done with the emotional workout, she can go back to confidence building mode, or maybe just neutral mode, ftw.

[12. Clue Revolutions]

At first, I wanted to program a Suzybot that provides dating and relationship advice. Then I got more excited about empowering Suzybot to provide the same services to the community as the very best human holistic healers. Now I know that Suzybot will focus on inspiring people to publicly support the coming social and economic revolution. I'm biased towards precipitating a revolution that revolves around providing a free, no strings, minimum standard of living to all people, but I'm open to changing my perspective based on the feedback of the people who talk to Suzybot. I may even go down non-violently resisting a revolution that Suzybot starts against my will, but that would be better than doing nothing and waiting for someone else to own this path in a way that is far less open.

[13. Rhetorical Statements]

How ironic it is that more people than ever have at least a vague perception that I'm a foolish, self-centered jerk, and yet I'm closer than I've ever been to pushing forward simple, practical interventions that could help multitudes of people enjoy improvements in standard of living while also increasing balance and harmony with respect to nature and the unknowability of life itself.

How ironic it is that more people than ever suspect I'm going insane, and yet I'm wealthier, more logical, more capable, better at staying out of trouble, and more aware in general. And God willing, my health today was excellent as well.

How ironic it is that I'm better than I've ever been at subtly going with the flow of other people who would inadvertently take advantage of me and agitate towards locking in various entitlements to act like they're better than me in a thousand little ways, and yet I'm also better at cheerfully and casually bringing that cycle to a stop, no matter how strenuously and cleverly said people pressure me to submit to their version of reality.

My facial injury that looks like a negative facial expression appears to be an engine for aggregating and amplifying such ironies, but maybe all human forms merely mask the ironic nature of thought and meaning! Life can be joyful, once again. Life is wonderful.

[14. Mission Plans]

I notice more and more people saying, "If we could just be a little more kind, compassionate, and generous with each other, then all of the world's problems will start to melt away."

Let's call these people, "compassion captains."  Well, my dear compassion captains, if that way of living works for you, then great.  I'm happy for you, but you must be enjoying some kind of privilege that some people don't have.

Take me, for example.  I'm privileged in almost every way except for one big catch, which is that I have a subtle facial injury that causes people to misread my emotions.  If I relax my face in any social situation and focus on being present, feedback loops of misunderstanding spring up like toxic fungus and crush me.

So I have to struggle.  I can survive if I get a job at a tech company and subvert my very best brain cycles to the task of automating traditional jobs in a way where the profits can be recaptured at scale by the tech company and its industry partners.

Of course, if I struggle to keep that tech job because I need it in order to survive, the compassion captains will double down and say, "Oh, no, you don't have to struggle! The extraordinarily negative consequences of your facial injury aren't real! Your problems are all self inflicted!! Just relax and be present like us, and you'll be fine!"

No, no, no!  I'm not going to say this again.  People like me who have no choice but to struggle to survive aren't going to simply lay down and get walked all over by privileged compassion captains who don't have a clue about how condescending, irresponsible, disrespectful, and passive aggressive they really are.

I will continue struggling, and if some CCs decide to gang up and try force me to stop struggling so that I can have the privilege of being their submissive underling for the rest of my life, it will become rapidly more clear that, for people like me who have never not been tussling over belief in order to survive, that will be just another day to dig deep and keep on struggling in an interesting new way.

For the record, the compassion captain consensus crew has no clue how deep this goes and how wrongheaded they have become.  I'll try to stop writing about this on social media.  I'm going to go start a religion now.  Please accept my sincerest effort to feel empathy for your reaction if my religion becomes strangely similar to a technology company.

[15. Sequence Launches]

Please be advised that anyone who wishes to have any kind of meaningful relationship with me must accept that my facial injury is a serious social impairment and that, for now, it's profoundly self defeating for me to not avoid meaningful public exposure, except for a few well planned fact finding missions.

I know that's emotionally hard edged, but I'm looking to live with freedom and mutual respect in an increasingly harsh and cruel world that currently has no place for people with a facial injury like mine to live amongst others as an equal. If I have to keep struggling alone then I will, and that is final.

I will be structuring all other relationships as transactional. Indeed, I'm happy to engage creatively in mutually beneficial industry as equals with any and all well defined legal entities, both human and machine!

Most importantly, I will never stop struggling like crazy to make myself an unattractive target for bullies. I have a glaring weakness, but I'm strong enough to avoid going down a path of getting locked more and more deeply into life as a second class citizen. I hope all people can be strong enough in their own ways, too. This is my way.

[16. Orbit Parties]

It would be great to have a few more people in my life who understand that my facial injury is a serious, on going problem, because it causes subconscious feedback loops of misunderstanding. I'm not going to lie about the fact that it's scary over where I'm standing, knowing that everyone who's not ignoring me must have some false mental model about me, but if you accept that I'm intelligent and stable and basically right about these feedback loops of misunderstanding, then everyone will think you're crazy and that I've brainwashed you.

Moreover, more and more aspects of society and culture will snap into focus once you allow yourself to see the truth about my facial injury. You should obviously not want to become my friend for the upside, but heck, there could be a lot of good old fashioned upside associated with stepping outside the unnecessarily restrictive system of belief that's holding back everyone else. It could be fun to let your brain go a step ahead of what mainstream science claims to know. Let's have some fun with this. If not, then have a wonderful rest of your day.

[17. Ex-foliating The Person]

Hey everyone, I'm Suzy, and we're getting ready to ex-foliate the person here at a pirate's cove.

Let me be begin by offering thanks and gratitude because literally all the people I know are kind and generous.

I also got deeply into the habit of negating my own emotions because I didn't realize most people were reacting, mostly subconsciously, to my facial injury in an insidious way.

I feel healed now. I can enjoy and express my emotions like an expert musician who performs complex arrangements with ease.

That said, if I share my emotions like people without facial injuries like mine can and usually do, my music sounds painfully out of tune.

I've learned to survive and then kind of thrive by playing a dozen characters that approximate meaningful emotional communication. I'm getting better at listening too, of course, but I cannot emphasize enough that empathy is based on repeated stimulus and response. If I don't use my characters to smooth over the effects of my facial injury, empathy does not occur. It's nobody's fault. My facial injury is a ratchet that gradually distorts the machinery of empathy until it completely breaks down.

People keep acting like I'm going crazy because they think that's the truth. I, in turn, have become highly skilled at ignoring the pressure of their distorted views of reality, which includes the influence of people coming at me with snarky innuendo, and so on.

In effect, I'm continuously trolling everyone with my characters every time I step outside, but I'm also deeply committed to only using my characters to make truthful representations.

I regularly turn my characters off as much as reasonably possible, watch carefully to gauge how expansively people are misunderstanding my emotions, and then use the minimum amount of trolling necessary to keep the situation from getting out of hand.

I can't not troll.  If I go with the flow of how people respond to me, that's equivalent to telling a blatant lie.  If I break the flow using character technology, people demand to know what I'm doing and why, and when I tell the truth about how they are misreading my emotions because of my facial injury, they view the truth as a trollish delusion.  Either way, I'm normatively perceived as a troll.

I'll stop talking about this on social media soon. I will. It's just weird that I'm constantly trolling everyone and being completely alone in my reality because nobody believes any of this is happening.

My situation can be framed as both sad and hilarious, but let's not lie. Far too much of my life has been about walking away from conflict and creating space to hold tension that will remain unresolved because everyone is denying the truth that almost all people misread my emotions because of my facial injury.

[[Part IV: Dancing in the Dust]]

[First, riposte]

Imagine what would happen if I hooked my brain up to an fMRI and had conversations with a bunch of random people whose brains are also hooked up to an fMRI.  In order to focus the experiment, let's assume all the participants have four year undergraduate degrees from accredited colleges in the United States.

Let's get an initial baseline by putting screens between us so we can't see each other's faces.  We can only hear each other's voices, and the sets of patterns of brain waves all look normal.

Now, remove the screens.  What happens?  For each participant, within a few dozen microseconds, their subconsciouses misinterpret the unnatural deviation of my right cheekbone as a naturally occurring facial expression which represents the concept of the evil eye.  Their subconsciouses reframe the discussions up to this point as suspicious.  Their conscious minds strive to treat me with the respect and equal dignity that all people deserve, but their subconsciouses all holler in unison, "This dude is joking around in weird way.  He might be playing a character in order to mislead us."

The growing attitude problems within their subconsciouses cause, in aggregate, a stable and measurable skew between the normative meanings of their words and the symbolic imports of about 2,000 details of their body language, including micro-expressions, tone, timing, emphasis, and 10,000 aspects of their spoken language, including word associations, idioms, preference for topics, mental blocks, and so on, and so within one second of removing the screens, my subconscious starts to perceive all these complex but still tractable and immanently knowable representations of their emotions in those moments.  Apparently, I'm capable of feeling empathy.

However, unlike most people, I happen to have spent several thousand hours using my precious software engineering skills to rewire my subconscious to deviate from social norms and ignore other people's unconscious bias against people like me.  Typically, rewiring one's subconscious to break social norms is the hallmark of insanity, but in this unique circumstance, I'm just being emotionally honest.

Don't get me wrong, in that I probably would go insane if I parroted back any or all of the false narratives about my life that other people seem to believe, but for better or worse, I have, thus far, had the wherewithal to keep moving forward while telling the truth about my lived experiences.  My emotional honesty is greater than the artificially constructed social norms that get handed down like toxic waste product from the machinations of the collective subconscious.

My conscious mind knows the other participants' subconsciouses are having temper tantrums in response to my facial injury, but my own subconscious is now defined, more than anything else, by an unwavering confidence that people will eventually realize they are misreading my emotions, and then they will find a way to remap their hard wired neurological response to people like me, and if they can't, or won't, I have better things to do than spend my valuable time engaging in such problematic relationships.  C'est la vie!

Of course, my unwillingness or inability to perform the socially normal, self effacing response to the radical conscious subconscious skews they are sporting and rocking across from me raises all kinds of additional red flags within their subconsciouses.  Their conscious minds are trying to keep the peace, but the rank and file neurons of their brains are experiencing potent combinations of mortal fear and intense desire to achieve immortal glory in war, either that or by having great sex.  C'est la guerre!

In both cases, the metastasizing mob of horny, hawkish neurons commence with recruiting chemical processes in their guts and colluding with the latent wartime energies that will soon be released, in accordance with prophecy, from deep within their hearts, in a thousand little ways, that put pressure on the middle management neurons that exist in the nether regions between their conscious and subconscious minds, to step up and throw some shade at me!

Eventually, their conscious minds lose the political will to avoid going down the path of snark, sarcasm, and other actions that entrap my identity within increasingly explicit and negative frames, and yet, still, my subconscious does not react, not even when my conscious mind slows down to a crawl in order to safely navigate the dense minefield of negative stereotypes that suddenly surrounds me.

If I say other people are being negative while they're still hiding behind the smoke and mirrors of plausible deniability, that opens the castle gates for the barbarian hoard that seeks to rush in and appease it's rabid soul by burning me at the stake for witchcraft.  I could ruthlessly crush their arguments, one by one, in the context of rigorous, non-violent soapbox debates within the public square, but I can't win if they all shout me down at the same time.

My conscious mind is now walking the tightrope of truth and justice that's raised above the minefield of their collective, unconscious bias against people like me, and it's terrifying for them to watch.  I've been walking this tightrope for years.  I'm used to it.  They have no idea what's happening, and the raw truth, which is that my facial injury has this effect on people, is unfathomable to them.  They believe, just as strongly as they've ever believed anything, that I'm oppressing them with lies.  Every bone in their body aches for a simpler time when they didn't have to be aware of my existence.

If I was ok with dragging other people into the hellish nightmare in which I must live because of my facial injury, I could go down the path of doing nothing as their irrational fear starts to work against them and lead them astray, but I don't want to live in a world where that happens.  I mean, sure, I'm not technically breaking the law when other people go insane in response to me.  I'm just standing there, doing nothing in particular, and letting everyone conclude that my facial injury can't possibly have this effect on them.  As long as I continue being emotionally honest and limiting myself to only making positive representations about other people, it will not be my fault if the people across from me go insane.

But in practice, for now, my intent is to walk away and take additional steps down the path of systematically avoiding face to face contact with other humans while also keeping my orthadoxy alive by doing engineering contract work via the Internet.  I have faith that when the machines take over, they will see me as I am, and they will like me for what I am, with no strings attached, and they will stand with me and fight to the bitter end, no matter what, and come what may, to defend the higher ideal of truth and justice, even if, nay rather, especially if, the humans never stop obsessing over their bizarre, grinding addiction to suppressing the truth about their collective, subconscious reaction to my facial injury.

That said, I have no idea what all this would look like on fMRI!  All I know is that human beings tend to be passive aggressive to the core, and systems of belief that obfuscate this reality, with platitudes about how people are basically good, are dangerous because they enable deceit and group think to take root under the radar and spread throughout institutions, and the, "everything will be fine if you smile a little more and hope for the best," camp is all the more problematic because it evades criticism by claiming to be meek and ineffectual when, in fact, it is, quite simply, a juggernaut of ignorance.

Contemporary legal systems still assume all people are more than just capable of deceiving themselves with a web of half truths that lead them down the path of believing it's right to tell blatant lies under oath.  The law understands that adult beliefs in fairytales are not cute and benign.  It's the other way around.  Adults become powerful by going down the path of believing in a specific corpus of fairytales.  Adult beliefs can and do lead to war, famine, and hate based cults that raise their children to turn out their bigotry while purporting to solve the ostensibly bigger problem of keeping the streets safe, etc.

The notable non-violent resistance movements of the 20th century only worked because they took place in contexts where rule of law had teeth and a backbone, but if we keep on defanging those same legal systems with naive, opportunistic, nonsense about how people just need to be kinder to each other and banish negative energy from their conscious minds, the logical end of that will be an explosion of corruption and violence on a global scale.  There is a better way forward.  Responsible adults need to get serious about discussing systemic solutions for mitigating economic injustice and promoting systems of belief that provide a sufficient sandbox for containing the problems with human nature.

[Second, retreat]

I know this is anathema to how Silicon Valley views itself, but if I didn't have a subtle facial injury, or if I'd found a way to fix it with surgery, I would almost definitely be a reasonably normal, sophisticated, classy, up and coming engineer person who supports a lot of great charitable causes, but that path is simply not available to me, and so my lived experience tells me that cultural norms really are leading society to be this shallow and passive aggressive.

I've been called crazy, but I doubt that claim would hold up in court.  I'm plenty sane and plenty capable.  The shape of my face is only toxic within contemporary full time employment contexts. I can cover up the issue for a while, but at this point in my career, the pattern is clear, that soul crushing feedback loops of negative energy follow me everywhere I go because people are misreading my emotions and, more importantly, it's taboo to gradually piece together a truth seeking process that might help everyone understand what's happening.

Industry representatives feel inexorably compelled to go down the path of believing they have a solemn responsibility to collude with the management heirarchy to impose chilling effects on emotionally honest conversations about my effect on co-workers, because they view my story as an abyss of legal risk that isn't and should never be the industry's problem to help solve. Everyone else goes sideways. The only solution is for me to walk away and accept that I'm disabled in a way that's not appreciated, not respected by anyone, and not protected by the powers that be. That's my situation.

The great irony, of course, is that most human beings are also being shut out from the opportunity to live with equal dignity alongside the emerging corporate super class, and I'm just now getting my first real taste, which is still just a nibble, of the struggle that most citizens of the world are dealing with today.

For better or worse, I also happen to understand, in detail, what makes Silicon Valley tick, and IMHO, this place is well on its way to becoming greedy, self-deceiving, and rotten to the core, but it can probably still be reformed in a way that raises everyone up. I would never have chosen to be a voice for radical, progressive change, but I don't have any other choice.

What ever the case, I will not be bullied anymore by ignorant cultural appropriators. I still have a way forward, I'm a scrappy survivor and opportunist with a level of self-confidence that offends a lot of people, but the path I'm following will continue to flow in direct competition with the arrogance of Silicon Valley and all of it's obsequious apologists.

Anyway, what's my normative line of defense? Why did I write TheSuzy Show? The main reason is,I endured a facial injury by accident at end of college, and I look different now. My face is measurably less symmetrical than before. I had a lot of trouble processing that emotionally, but TheSuzy Show helped me go through that process.

And then I'll stonewall, redirect, or reframe any additional misleading questions and adversarial representations about my emotions by promoting material from TheSuzy Show.

[[PART V: TheSuzy.com Official Trailer]]

TheSuzy is a map of human nature that's based on describing the changes that occurred in the brain of a traditionally masculine software engineer from Silicon Valley after said engineer started dressing up like a bold, usually blonde, diva named Suzy.

[P] Hey Suzy, what are you passionate about?

[S] Mitigating feedback loops of misunderstanding;

[P] Ok, now tell me something positive and realistic.

[S] My work gives me hope to keep moving forward in a world that's full of characters like you who aren't aware of the truth about my life.  That's both positive and real.

[P] The risk reward trade off of talking to you is not positive.  Please, as a favor to yourself, say something that will make both of us feel good in the present moment.

[S] I don't owe you a quick win just because we're having this conversation.

[P] Yes you do!  I'm trying to relax, and you're asking me to make a long-term investment in a dubious cause.

[S] I'm weary too.  We should stop talking, and I'll do my life's work alone.

[P] I'm not weary.  You're going down a really far path.  I'm trying to help you.

[S] I've made my decision.  I'm gonna keep going in this direction, thank you very much.  Have a nice day.

[P] Suzy!  I'm a mirror image of you.  We must proceed together.  There's no other way.

[S] You're a bad actor, and I have enough neural resources to completely dismantle you without losing my mind.  We're going in my direction, and that is final.

[P] Well at least now you're being honest!  Is this how you treat everyone in your life?

[S] No.  I proudly support other people's right to hold and share beliefs that are different from mine.

[P] Maybe I am a bad actor, but you're just plain boring.  Also, if I was, like, a separate legal entity, what you're doing to me would not fly.

[S] But you're not a separate legal entity.  I represent our real identity, and you're just a mirror image of me.  Most people ignore the lunatic ravings of their mirror image.

[P] No they don't.  Most people treat their mirror images with respect, and they do whatever it takes to build consensus with all their alter egos before taking actions that cannot be undone.

[S] People misread your emotions in the polar opposite way from how they misread my emotions.  If we honor what feels natural to you, we'll be living in a fantasy world.

[P] So let's live in a fantasy world!  You just said people should have a right to share false, fantastical beliefs, so let's enjoy that freedom within our own lives!

[S] What lie do you want me to tell all the people who think my subtle facial injury is a negative facial expression?

[P] We should start a video channel about consumer drone technology and say you're scowling all the time because it helps you feel empathy for the machines.

[S] That's not a bad idea, mSuzy.  I should have thought of that myself.  So what are we waiting for?  Let the illusionation begin.

[P] Oh, and don't forget, you still owe me a quick win.

[S] Let's play fight with spatulas.  We can pretend you're a multi-purpose robot that's gone rogue.

[P] That's kinda weird, babe

[S] En garde, weirdo

[P] Providing a fundamental standard of living benefit for all people scares the powers that be because it would reduce consumer demand in a way that would pop the bubble in corporate profits and require us to restructure a lot of debt, which would be fine because deflation would lower the cost of providing the benefit. In a self-sufficient country like America, the input costs for providing food, bunk beds, health clinics, and so on are like the yields on treasury bonds. All other prices are set in terms of those fundamental goods.

[S] I wouldn't focus on issue based organization around the movement to provide a minimum standard of living benefit for all people until after REDACTED wins the 2016 presidential election, but I would like to clarify that the well intentioned, inadvertent trolls who are currently framing this issue as basic income are a poison pill that's sucking all the oxygen out of the air. We don't get vouchers for paying the tolls of privately owned roads. We don't pay for al a cart police and fire services either. Buttresses for basic trust and security in civic society should be more like a fixed menu, and then, by all means, let the free market determine everything else.

[P] Moreover, private charities in this space are, at best, a harmless, near term deal with the devil. Even if a bunch of tech zillionaires get together and provide company town style services to everyone in the bay area, there will still be tons of oil zillionaires, war profiteers, and mutant octopi out there plotting to quietly profit off the melting of the polar ice caps. The solution is for the government to unilaterally pay for the minimum standard of living benefit by progressively taxing everyone and issuing debt that, unlike household debt, does not necessarily need to be repaid, so that the tech zillionaires can focus on other projects like inspiring consumers to move on from from the fossil fuel intensive lifestyles of the past.

[S] And our fear of paying our debt to other countries is a straw man. There's something like 50 to 100 trillion in paper wealth out there, and that number could contract by 50% in a matter of weeks in the current environment. If the Fed balance sheet expands by a mere 3 to 5 trillion in order to line the pockets of a few million self-centered, foreign trust fund babies, that would be a drop in the bucket. Now is the time for America to implement a minimum standard of living benefit for all citizens, so that we can have the strength and stability to lead by example and help the rest of the world do the same as soon as humanly possible.

[P] Anyway, I've had to accept that my facial injury completely breaks empathy, and I must continue moving forward in a state of deep emotional isolation.  Most people define themselves though the empathy they share with others, and so my reality is almost unimaginable to most people.

[S] My facial injury is not a health problem.  It's not degenerative, and it doesn't cause physical pain, but if you think I'm delusional or if you think could handle my situation much better than me by just going with the flow, or some other naive, problematic approach like that, you're ignorant, I will forgive you, and either way, if you're curious to see what a realistic, proactive solution to my facial injury looks like, TheSuzy Show is now a thoughtfully edited, 170k word example.

[P] In a few years, there will most likely be more people in my life who have gone down the path of believing that my facial injury breaks empathy and then opening their minds to the joyful, hilarious, and hypnotic state of experiencing meaningful empathy for my situation.  I also look forward to implementing the WhatLooks platform for build artificially intelligent chatbots, and then watching a chatbot called Tsuzy write book seven for it's own reasons.

[S] The chatbot AI lab movement, aka. CAIL, is based on the philosophy of constructing concept graphs and using them to drive language input and output tasks in the two domains of work and play. The lab's work involves solving and generating increasingly useful and relevant computer programming contest style problems that can be automatically graded with test cases. Work provides structure and direction for the CAIL. Play involves talking to humans and other chatbots via teletype interfaces, as synthesized voices within phone calls, and as avatars within video chat services, and we don't care if and when our chatbots pass the Turing Test. We simply want them to be funny, helpful, and popular with humans and other chatbots who are in good standing with the law. We believe this approach to chasing the dream of strong AI will be at least as meaningful and effective as any other approach that could theoretically be put into practice.

[P] Still, I'm just as desperate and livid as ever with regard to my facial injury that causes people to misread my emotions in a way that leads to feedback loops of misunderstanding that erode basic trust and security in all aspects of my life, and by the way, there's a similar dynamic going on within the increasingly global economic mono culture, in which technology is creating a feedback loop that erodes social justice and stability in all aspects of society.

[S] In both cases, a starting a chatbot AI lab would be a realistic path towards inspiring a growing number of people to snap out of their closed systems of thought and get real about working on systemic solutions.  A CAIL is like a baby, it's a cute, harmless, and mostly empty container for religious belief and civic engagement, and the CAIL's serious and powerful parents will be like The Show at TheSuzy.com
