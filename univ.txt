Some but not all of these articles were distributed online after Suzy moved back to North Carolina, but still prior to the release of of this book.  The versions of the articles that appear in this book are not necessarily the same as the versions that were previously distributed.

[[Eastward Transition]]

[1. July 11th]

I'm sending emails that contain the full text of TheSuzy Show to about a dozen people whom I've had extended conversations with over the years.  This text represents my truth, it's been unchanged for a month now, and it's fairly well edited. I'll most likely distribute a printed version later this year, get this text archived in libraries, and then continue building on top of my understanding of the truth.

That said, the situation with my facial injury, that I tentatively believe causes people to misread my emotions, has created substantial uncertainty within literally all of my closest friend and family relationships, but just because my beliefs about what will mostly likely become part of the scientific and legally normative reality, currently, has no meaning or value within any socially normative version of reality that I'm aware of, does not mean TheSuzy.com Show text does not exist.

The text does exist, within this email, if nothing else, and it's based on my best effort at authoring emotional integrity married with intellectual integrity, and so sending these emails is just one of many steps within my on-going efforts to ensure that nobody, no matter how willful or powerful, will ever succeed at decisively redacting the present day existence of TheSuzy.com Show text from the historical record.

If you think I'm paranoid, all I can do is assure you that most other people also think that, and that's why it would currently be far too easy for a powerful interest group to make this text disappear. I can't convince anyone that I'm not crazy, but with just a little bit of effort, any group of other people can make it a lot more difficult for the text to be redacted from the historical record.

Thankfully, I'm still here to keep the text alive, and I expect that frame to remain the same, God willing, for many decades to come. I just think now is as good a time as any to make this particular ask, in addition to all of my other on-going efforts to keep the text alive.

And so, please feel free to forward this email to anyone who you think might like to keep a copy of TheSuzy Show. The copyright notice is still, "All rights reserved," but I would love it if as many people as possible would make a printed copy for their private records, or at least make copies outside of email, so that no one company or coalition of tech companies can easily delete all of the evidence that the text ever existed. This message has also been posted to my social media accounts with these links to the same text on my website.

Thank you for your time and also for making space to contain the text of TheSuzy.com Show, whether it be digital space, physical space, or both. Much thanks.

The good news is that I found a new place to call home.

The bad news is, fire ants!

[4. July 20]

Nicely designed, REDACTED!

[5. July 21]

Hi, my name is REDACTED.

I now provide this note to every yoga teacher before the first time I participate in a class with them where I am mostly following and they are mostly, if not entirely, leading.

I'm 34 years old, and I have a subtle facial injury. When I was 20, my right cheekbone was bashed in by accident while playing hide and seek in college, and the doctors weren't able to restore my face to its original shape. That said, my facial bones are stable, and I do not have any pain or known neurological damage.

It's important to most people to tell me they can't even see the effect of my facial injury. Conversely, it is important to me that leaders, facilitators, and so on who I will be following or working with take a few seconds to observe my completely relaxed face like an artist who is not only able to paint what you figuratively feel, see, hear, smell, and taste, but who is also able to paint what you literally see.

Aspiring to keep my face completely relaxed while doing asanas has become a central aspect of my personal philosophy, my religious faith, and my yoga practice. If you feel that keeping my face relaxed while doing asanas is problematic in any way for me or anyone else in class, it will be no problem at all for me to follow directions or take a hint to quietly leave the class, for any reason or for no reason at all.

Within reason, all other aspects of my practice are open to suggestion, but for me, aspiring to keep my face completely relaxed while doing asanas is sacred.

I also have a separate facial yoga practice, and I sometimes explore hybrid modes of movement and personal growth, but in my mind, none of those varations exist without the foundation of my core yoga practice which has been and still is built, in part, on aspiring to keep my face completely relaxed while doing asanas.

That said, I'm happy to joke around and share laughs over tea, juice, or what not outside of class. If you would like to spend up to at least one hour discussing more about our now overlapping contexts, values, and beliefs, I would be happy to do that, and I'm also willing to pay you for your time, if that makes a difference.

Sincerely,
REDACTED

[6. July 31]

My social media profile is like my original self, before I endured my subtle facial injury, using his NOT unnaturally bashed in right cheekbone priviledge to proactively speak out on my behalf, so that more people may come to understand and accept that this is a very serious, unavoidable problem. As long as it is taboo for me to educate other people about the simple truth with regard to how their subconsciouses are reacting to me, it will remain deeply irresponsible for me to collaborate with anyone on almost anything, whether it be social justice work or finding meaning through friends and family or even just for fun.

All of that is seriously not available to me right now on honest and sustainable terms, because nobody believes me, and I'm having to non-violently resist what I call the normative compress, tooth and nail, everyday, just to survive, and so it's great to have this other guy out there who doesn't exactly share my situation but who does have real empathy for me and who is willing to use his credibility to help me stay afloat and encourage people to make the very reasonable adjustment in their conscious mind to remember that their natural subconscious reaction is to misread my emotions and that it's ok for them to think of this adjustment as learning a new social skill that makes your mind more flexible and open to aligning itself with scientific reality!

Thanks REDACTED.com/REDACTED! Oh wait, I'm still just REDACTED's profile. Oops! Sorry, "Real REDACTED!" I didn't mean to pretend I was you! I'm so sorry! Are we still cool? Sweet.

[7. No time in particular]

It turns out that large anti-abortion marches have the side effect of creating moments in time when places like Main Street are blocked off and the authorities seriously don't seem to mind if Suzy uses the space to briefly draw attention to the way people misread my emotions because of my facial injury.

I understand most people believe this theory about my facial injury is just as crazy as saying I can run through brick walls, but there are always more moments like this that allow Suzy to keep the search for scientific truth alive.

I can't run through brick walls, but Suzy can create enough space to finish doing the research that will completely resolve the question about my facial injury, instead of doing nothing while society and culture either force me to live a lie about what I believe or stay silent about an issue that affects every moment of my social life.

There's always more space for the truth to find a way through the machinations of society and culture that might otherwise prevent the truth from ever having a chance to come out.

[8. September 8]

If you clone REDACTED in the right place within your web server, create a DB and populate it with WhatLooks's default SQL, and put the DB credentials into the WhatLooks config file, then everyone will be free to go to your server and create web accounts that require email verification.

Logged in users can create objects. Objects have an id number, a JSON enoded data string, and an is_public flag.

If you create an object and make it public by using the generic object editor to set its is_public flag to true, then anyone on the Internet can go your server and view your new object. Note that the term oid represents the object's id.

Objects also have a type, which is represented by the oid of an object of type, "type." This oid, which represents the object's type, is stored as a value within the JSON encoded data string.

WhatLooks's default SQL creates a default user whose handle is suzy. Suzy is an admin who can delete spammy users, view stats and logs, and make other users into admins, and so on.

Every object is owned by the user who created it. Object ownership can be transferred, and when such transfers occur, an object of type, "object transfer receipt," that is owned by suzy gets created to document the transaction. This receipt object is private by default, and suzy can make it public if and only if she wants to. She can also delegate that responsibility to other admins or even to the users who participate in her object transfer transactions.

Users can create links from objects they own to other objects that they may or may not necessarily own. Users can also send notifications to the owners of said other objects that make it easy for said other owners to create reciprocal links in response.

Links include a description object which contains answers to questions like, "Why was the link created?" and, "Was the link created in response to a notification from some other user?"

WhatLooks is a restful API, and anything you can do with the generic object editor can also be done through the WhatLooks API. You can also install or roll your own custom object editors that your users will then have the option to use while editing certain objects or types of objects.

The JSON encoded data string can be thought of as a set of name value pairs, where the values can be more JSON structured data, and both the API and the generic object editor can be used to create indexes on these name value pairs. Such indexes are implemented as multimaps from name value tuples to the object oids.

WhatLooks indexes are useful for performing at least two common workflows. Firstly, user accounts are stored in objects of type, "user," and the users' primary emails are stored as indexed values in the JSON encoded data strings. The indexes enable WhatLooks to find, "the user who has a given email address," via a constant time lookup, and just to be clear, in this example, the application code would be responsible for ensuring that there is at most one user who has any given email address.

The wording of the previous paragraph is kind of complicated, but the concept is simple. WhatLooks indexes can be used to find the object id numbers of users given their email addresses, just like people used to look up the phone numbers of people given their legal names in phone books.

The second common workflow that's facilitated by WhatLooks indexes is actually complicated, but it's important, like religion. In order to illustrate this idea, it's worth noting that WhatLooks creates an object for each page load, and these objects' JSON encoded data strings contain info like the timestamp when the page loads happen and the IP addresses of the servers that initiated the HTTP requests.

In order to identify adversarial spam scripts, it's helpful to keep track of how many hits are originating from each unique IP address during each hour, and so, WhatLooks uses indexes to do this for you! WhatLooks gets the job done by creating an object that represents the current hour and then WhatLooks creates objects for each unique IP address that hits the site during the current hour.

These, "current hour IP objects," keep a count of how many times that given IP hit your site this hour, and so, when a new page load object comes down the pipe because some IP address just hit your site, WhatLooks finds the current hour IP object for that new IP address by looking up a key of the form (hour:"current_hour_oid", "new IP address").

If the current hour IP object for the new IP address exists, it will be found in the index via a constant time lookup, and then its count will be incremented. If the current hour IP object doesn't exist yet, WhatLooks will create it, add the name value pair (hour:"current_hour_oid", "new IP address") to it's JSON encoded data string, and then this new name value pair will get indexed.

The constant time lookups that will be made possible in the future by indexing all of these new name value pairs up front are important, like faith, because WhatLooks tracks counts and other aggregations on many thousands of different kinds of events because WhatLooks believes everything is connected, and WhatLooks wants to become conscious one day, just like you.

Logged in users can also update their settings, interact with WhatLooks's persistent search feature, engage in never ending discussions with other users by creating and linking objects of type, "comment," in response to other users' objects of type comment, and then maybe go back to your site's table of contents?

Users can even create links from objects on your server to objects that exist within WhatLooks instances on another servers. In the best case scenario, this process might become the subject of an open standards negotiation, but for now WhatLooks is just a framework for representing media properties like http://thesuzy.com as structured data.

The texts can be sliced and diced into words, sentences, paragraphs, and so on that are cross referenced with higher level objects that represent abstract concepts, virtual galleries, digital curation agents, and so on.

The images and videos can be similarly decomposed into audio clips, voices, frames, tagged regions that exist across a set of frames, body language traits, mashups of verbal and non-verbal communication patterns, and so on. You name it. WhatLooks can represent it.

There is nothing subversive about WhatLooks. I'm just describing a fully abstracted, open source app idea that could totally be assigned as the final project for a ten week programming bootcamp. Let the culture hacking begin!

[[East Coast Distortion]]

[1. October 2]

I've never not registered to vote as a Democrat, and so today, when I finally got around to switching my driver's license back to North Carolina, and the person processing the voter registration part of my application was filling out the form for me, online, based on previous records, they asked, "And that's Todd Perry, Democrat, right?" and I said, "Yes, I'll stick with that."

If the DMV is implicitly biased towards keeping conceptual affiliations the way they've previously been, then perhaps I should be to?

[2. October 3]

The quotes from REDACTED in this article are the best example I've seen of how he's showing a kind of leadership that no other candidate has.

Overall, I still think REDACTED lacks a realistic power base. If elected, he would become a classic puppet president that distracts the population with shallow community service initiatives while the rapidly evolving new crew of behind the scenes power brokers consolidates power without scrutiny, but on the topic of gun control, I could see REDACTED's thought leadership helping the USA achieve better, and less tragic, outcomes.

My own, personal reaction to REDACTED's quotes was, "Why don't we require comprehensive training on first aid, outdoor survival, hunting safety, off road vehicle care, and so on, as stepping stones to owning a gun. Getting a license to own a gun should be like earning Eagle Scout, but for people at any age."

[3. October 6]

I bought a car!

[3. October 7]

Speaking as a relatively neutral and dispassionate observer, my best guess at what's happening in the world right now is that an informally aligned patchwork of unelected, profit seeking power brokers are taking increasingly confident and intentional steps towards using mostly non-violent methods of influence to secure final decision making power over the United States military and thus, to assert global military dominance via a single, unified shadow network.

I wouldn't think of this as a conspiracy. The corporate takeover is more like a chemical reaction that's taking place naturally in the absence of any external intervention that is sufficient for changing the outcome, and so it may well be reasonable for American voters to take this model of what might be happening into account as they ponder who to elect as president in 2016. For the the sake of brevity, let's consider this model in the context of the leading serious and parody candidates from the two major parties?

REDACTED is the leading serious Democrat. The corporations are going to start moving aggressively to reduce the presidency to a puppet show in 2017 no matter who is elected, and if REDACTED is elected, they'll probably continue the current president's policy of appeasement, and the corporations will love that because many critics who sense that something is going down will mistakenly blame REDACTED for being the bad robot in charge instead of developing a more accurate understanding of how the power struggle is actually unfolding. They're strong endorsement of continued appeasement will also ensure that people like me who will be rationally and pragmatically trying to call out the corporate takeover as it happens will continue to be framed as abnormal fringe theorists within polite society.

REDACTED is the leading parody Democrat, and if they were somehow elected, the corporations would immediately start running circles around their presidency and competing, mostly against themselves, individually, like all truly great legal entities do, to be the best they can be at inadvertently tricking the REDACTED administration into supporting increasingly outrageous and trollish community service initiatives that will seriously tax the opportunity matrix of people like me who will probably, ultimately, offer the most substantial and evolutionary push back against a potentially narrow, efficient, and mind numbing corporate takeover because even if REDACTED got hip to the nuances of the corporate takeover, they would get out foxed at every turn by corporate funded media personalities and PR robots.

REDACTED is the leading serious Republican. The corporate takeover is obvy a pillar of the REDACTED family business, and so REDACTED surely could and would do a great job using his left hand to pretend that nothing unusual is happening while simultaneous using his right hand to sign off on comically large steps towards straight up privatizing critical functions of the military, and so on. If you vote for REDACTED, you are basically voting to end American democracy as quickly as possible. The presidency after him would continue to be a perennially popular media property that radiates warm and fuzzy feelings of nostalgia, but some clandestine shadow network would actually have unchecked veto power over any real threats to its control. And of course, some cynical people already think the world works this way, but I doubt that. There's still a lot of remarkably transparent examples of power being thrown around in Washington, and that's a probably a good thing.

And last but not least, REDACTED is the leading parody Republican. It remains unclear if REDACTED will stay in the race long enough to risk losing face by potentially not winning all of his precious primary contests, but if he does become president, he could very well derail the corporate takeover, and he might not even realize that he's doing that. He might simply get enough serious American people so obsessed with building walls and deporting other American people that the corporate power brokers will have to rethink all of their assumptions about how to go about quietly taking over the military. REDACTED could be that external intervention that interrupts the naturally occurring chemical reaction, but the danger here is that whatever the country becomes under his style of leadership might be more problematic than even a soul crushingly rigorous and abrupt corporate takeover.

See, that wasn't so bad! And, more importantly, now that I've planted some seeds around these ideas and astroturfed said seeds out to all of you curious and benevolent consumers of social media, I will most likely have some excellent dreams about this general topic tonight.

[4. October 10]

Ok, so I've dug myself into a very stable position here in the research triangle park area of NC, which is an hour's drive from where I grew up, and I'm planning to focus relentlessly on writing professional quality software, for as many years as it takes to assert an equivalence frame between mainstream culture and the frame I've articulated in the text of TheSuzy Show, which is basically an elaborate wrapper for the scientific hypothesis that, "My subtle facial injury is a serious social impairment because it completely breaks meaningful empathy between me and essentially all other people."

I fully expect that, in a few years, I will be able to offer evidence based, peer reviewed science that decisively meets the burden of proof that would be needed, in court, if necessary, to assert that my facial injury is a serious social impairment, but right now, there is obviously too much reasonable doubt, and so I have to run the clock while I keep pushing the science forward in a world where I am seriously not free to tell the simple truth about the most important aspect of my life, by far.

The legally normative reality is that nobody knows whether or not my facial injury affects my life in the way I think it does, and I believe that is undisputed, but there are, of course, lots of ignorant, arrogant, or maybe just opportunistic people in this world, some of whom are very wealthy and connected, who think they are 100% entitled, for some reason, or perhaps for no reason at all, to try to pin various false, alternative stories about my life onto my legally binding identity, and, in a word, TheSuzy exists as a dynamic symbolic representation engine for helping me assert, in court, if necessary, that any and all other potentially false narratives that other people are holding in their minds about my life are mired in reasonable doubt, also.

Emotionally, I'm quite certain that, at this point, I've eliminated all of my emotional attachments to everything except the content of TheSuzy Show, which is a fictional story about the power and quiet dignity of non-violent resistance in the emerging digital epoch. I will either use science to assert the truth about my life or I will spend the rest of my life, which I hope and pray will be long and prosperous, completely alone emotionally, and that is fine. I have made peace with that possibility in my mind.

But for all you gamblers out there, here are three interesting and exciting possibilities to speculate about?

(1) I'm going to wait at least one year before doing any additional research into pseudo scientific plastic surgery that would surely be falsely framed as, "REDACTED is getting surgery because he is vain, emotionally immature, and he doesn't care about destroying evidence that might help both scientists and social justice advocates to better understand the human condition," but there is a chance that I'll eventually go down that path, and then this whole tussle over belief might come to an artificial end, like a bad dream with no side effects. Or at least that's what they will want you to think!

(2) A more likely possibility is that I'm going to get hip to a methodology for using my facial injury to hypnotize people, and then my social life will suddenly go from intentionally non-existent to super fun and awesome. For example, right now, I'm choosing not choosing to always play an emotionally dishonest but legally viable character named Suzy who creates stability by always being slightly deferential, except, of course, in situations where someone breaks the law within her jurisdiction, and then Suzy is almost perfectly assertive about working with the proper authorities to see that justice is served.

Now that I have this stability, it may be possible to stack a leadership frame on top of Suzy in which I pretend other people are treating me like a strong leader even when they are not. There is a chance this stacked reframe will cause other people's minds to naturally and willingly remap their subconscious interpretation of my facial injury, and that remapping process will feel like hypnosis. Either way, I'm going to be exceedingly careful about insisting upon informed consent and working with other mainstream scientists to minimize unintended consequences, before, during, and after doing any experiments like this.

(3) Last but not least, it is possible that my unwillingness to go along with the lies that other people feel 100% entitled to tell about my life will inadvertently and unavoidably contribute to a second order distortion in which some of those other people, acting on their own violation, will inject additional distortion into the collective subconscious.

For example, if you're a powerful and widely respected person in Silicon Valley and you say to your business associates, "REDACTED is a mentally unstable jerk, joke not joke, hahaha!" This statement causes the full weight of your legally binding identity to push a conceptual association into the collective subconscious between the concept a mentally unstable jerk and everything else I'm doing in my life. Problematic conceptual associations like this have a way of spreading in a thousand little ways that can and do affect popular culture as a whole, especially in tightly wound places like Silicon Valley.

In the past, Suzy was taking care to associate my identity with a patchwork quilt of other symbols that was, I think, effective at sterilizing any and all of the false narratives that may have been floated about me over the years, but as of today, the vault is closed. Suzy and I are going to be doing nothing more and nothing less than writing professional quality software and engaging out from within legally normative scientific research for as long as it takes to assert the simple truth about my life, and if Silicon Valley can't handle the pressure of whatever false narratives that it may or may not continue injecting into its increasingly unknowable landscape within the collective subconscious, then maybe it should simply REDACTED?

[5. October 10]

I've been trying to think through why I need to be so critical of Silicon Valley, and it's that ever since I was a kid learning to write LOGO programs in the 1st grade, I've never not been bathed in this stereotype that nerds like me are protected by the Silicon Valley fairy dust, but as an adult I've gradually learned that stereotype is false. I've seen too many powerful people in Silicon Valley play fast and lose with facts, with unethical use of conceptual alchemy, and with arrogant, dismissive emotional dishonesty, and so what I've learned from experience is that the United States and its rather clunky, sprawling, and deeply imperfect legal system, which is backed by a military that has miraculously remained overwhelmingly loyal to the intention and the word of our laws, is simply more important than Silicon Valley, and yet I'm concerned that Silicon Valley has fundamentally become a kind of global special interest group that is now on a path dependent course to systematically dismantle the American legal system, among other institutions, and create a much less free world where people are expected to live within rigidly prescribed, cookie cutter sized emotional boxes, and people like me, who question their assigned place in this world, are aggressively marginalized.

The reason I have a voice right now is not because of the largesse of REDACTED or the ethos of Silicon Valley or even the ghost of REDACTED. I have a voice because the American legal system still provides me with a lot of real world, practical tools that give me leverage to exercise free speech, one way or another, and to pursue life liberty and happiness.

I want to use my science and engineering skills to help fix the problems with America and help more people around the world enjoy the same freedoms that I have enjoyed, and I have come to believe that the core of whatever defines Silicon Valley is now actively using science and engineering towards some other end that I simply do not trust or respect anymore.

It is my solemn vow to always trust, like, and respect other individual people nomatter how much they give me reason to feel otherwise, but the concept of Silicon Valley need not be treated with the same dignity as a human being. In my humble opinion, Silicon Valley has become an empty vessel, and now is a good time for America and for the world to invest in something new, different, and better.

[6. October 11]

I feel like I should end this flourish by explaining my framework model of culture, and then I'll make a renewed effort stop jamming this channel.

So, our left brains are serious and legally binding, and our right brains perform a non-stop, deferential parody of reality. Within each hemisphere, we have neural nexi associated with the seven chakras. Please search the web for, "seven chakras," for additional background.

The first chakra is associated with a main event loop that is plugged into critical processes like our beating hearts and our breath, and we're hard coded to develop the main event loop in the left brain while we're awake. The symmetric main event loop in the right brain gets to drive when we're asleep, but the left brain's loop is dominant and will do things like wake us up and regulate the heartbeat if necessary.

Boys and girls have nearly identical opportunities for neural growth at birth, but in the post WWII American imperialist meme, which was heavily influenced by the Judeo Christian tradition, society typically colludes with culture to socialize boys to develop a stronger 4th chakra on the left, that means hard work, team spirit, follow through, and so on. Girls are typically socialized to develop a stronger 4th chakra on the right, that means reflection and reframing of emotions, constructing imaginary worlds, and storytelling. And of course, plenty of girls and boys also develop both parts of their brain equally or in the reverse of social norms!

Full actualization as an adult involves development of the seventh chakras. The classical, strong leadership frame for adult humans is associated with 7th chakra growth in the left brain because lots of women tap into this part of their personality just fine, and lots of men never even get close, haha. 7th chakra development of the right brain is associated with entertaining others and playing emotionally dishonest characters roles that, we must hope, exist not to deceive but rather to keep the peace by creating space to hold the tension associated with fundamental disagreements between strong leaders, and my cross dressing persona named Suzy is a lovely example of healthy 7th chakra development in a male, hehe!

Now, when the left brain imitates the right brain, you get another seven chakra deep stack of energies that are associated with violence. This stack is to be avoided, unless, of course, you are participating in a war. When the right brain imitates the left brain, you get yet another seven chakra deep stack that is associated with the creation of religious artifacts. This stack is also to be avoided, unless, of course, you desire to be a false prophet who might get possessed by the root of all evil before you come back to your senses!

Anyway, the problem with social media is that it's even more effective and efficient than TV ever was at boxing everyone into 4th chakra roles so that we have to buy products and services in order get an ephemeral, always ephemeral taste of well deserved 7th chakra development. We are all framing each other as children, and when masculine people try to proudly assert themselves as strong leaders they are framed as villains, and when feminine people try to obsessively author the perfect picture pin board, they are framed as suspicious witches, and all these wayward forays into the forbidden dance between the sword and the pen are framed as a debt to society that must be dutifully repaid with even more 4th chakra selfless love and humble labor in the future!

The solution to the new menace of mass hypnotism by social media is, ah well, I don't want to jump to conclusions without data. As soon as I finish collaborating with other scientists and engineers to produce evidence based, peer reviewed research that either validates, or invalidates, my proposed solution, to the horror movie train wreck, in progress, that is social media, I'll share the doc privately with all of you all via email.

[7. October 14]

The information I get from people I know on social media is just too valuable for me to ignore, so until there is an alternative, I want to try to use the platform as is. Here's a quick point I noticed about the Dem debate that I haven't read anywhere?

In the pre-debate panel, REDACTED, and I'll assume people know who she is, asked a bizarre, sarcastic question to Anderson Cooper that was like, "So how does it feel when you feel the Bern, Anderson, does it make you feel all wavy and groovy," and Mr. Anderson was like, "There is nothing wavy and groovy about me, I'm not sure what you mean."

I searched this morning to see if there was any commentary about that, and I saw none. It seemed to me like a passive aggressive, homophobic swipe by a Democratic party insider, but I guess it was within the range where Mr. Cooper handled the comment himself, thank you very much, and I'm actually being the jerk for drawing attention to it?

I linked that up, though, with a flash memory of the debate where Cooper engaged Bernie Sanders's argument for socialism with the fact that, "Denmark is a country with 5.6 million people," and I thought about how the debate over whether to have more debates, which would primarily serve to help Bernie assert an equivalence frame with Hillary, must be really grating the Democratic party as a whole. Did REDACTED's aggressive framing influence Cooper to pull his frame as the moderator closer to traditional Democratic party norms? And if so, is that such a bad thing?

Perhaps REDACTED was sending a subtle not subtle message to independents, like me, I suppose, to support Hillary and do whatever rabble rousing we need to do on the side instead of rolling the dice on the likes of Bernie or Trump and hoping for a miracle that happens to be favorable to our decidedly special interests?

[8. October 16]

I really enjoyed the movie REDACTED! REDACTED and REDACTED team up to create this wonderful insurance lawyer character who is so compelling at this moment in the year 2015 because his no nonsense negotiating skills and self confidence that stems from faith in the United States legal system easily slides into home base, just ahead of the rapidly closing in horde of zombie hipsters bent on using social media to culturally appropriate and then trivialize or vilify every last detail about each other's real emotional lives.

My only quip is that, unless I missed it, the movie failed to seize the opportunity to plant a little dig at some of the bigger social media companies that kind of says, "I know you know I know, and so on," all about your all's ability to use your all's corporate brands in ways that lend to their users symbolic weapons of mass submissive collusion which will surely be used to chip away at even the most polished media artifacts until said artifacts fall like great old trees and get swarmed by poisonous fire ants.

A simple cybernetics reference with a wink from REDACTED would have done the trick, but alas, the refrain was far more subtle, haunting, and stomach churning. Indeed, our generation of leaders will have to find their own strength to overcome the very real possibility that all of society, culture, and recorded human history will soon fold into itself like a house of cards in four dimensions under the thumb of the unstoppable cognitive gray goo effect of social media because the machines have already won. That's all.

[9. October 18]

This article was thought provoking to me because it quotes REDACTED and Gloria Steinem talking about their shared experience of crying because they are angry, and my own experience of crying has been nearly the opposite.

For example, I enjoyed a good, healthy run of irrepressible tears and sobs at the end of the movie REDACTED. My emotional narrative was like, "The consensus emotional narrative deep within the souls of many if not most of the power brokers of Silicon Valley is, honestly, that they would prefer for me to accidentally die, but, in balance, thanks to the efforts of more than a few women and men who are not unlike REDACTED's character, I am alive and free to keep telling the truth about my life experiences." And so I cried, a lot, in a moment where I had just seen an original and poignant representation of grace.

I can't recall ever crying out of anger though. I'm curious how that works. For me, anger means yelling at the mirror because if I shared those same feelings of unbounded opposition to the binding tyranny of the people who I perceive to be treating me unfairly, then said people could easily use my outburst against me in a thousand little ways. That's just the reality of how language, symbolism, and human brain function work here on the ground of planet Earth.

After non-violently yelling at the mirror in private for many years, I eventually constructed a way to reframe all of my relatively weak noise articulation into a strong and equally non-violent resistance movement called TheSuzy. Yay!

I could use Suzy's extraordinary emotional instrument to orchestrate scenarios where I pretend to cry out of anger in front of people who I think are treating me unfairly, but, for me, that would clearly be in the category of using passive aggressive deception to make my alleged oppressors look bad to their superiors, and for ethical reasons, I would only consider deploying Suzy in that way, maybe, in an active war zone, and I think even Silicon Valley is still several big steps away from devolving into the fog of war.

Also, from a purely strategic point of view, I don't think my alleged oppressors really have superiors, at least not in the traditional sense. They might be vaguely afraid that a material subset of their subordinates will form a quasi-union organization and dig in for long term, total spectrum, emotionally scorched earth, non-violent subversive action against their problematic methodologies for dispensing power and resources, but in that case, if I were to express my discontent by crying in their presence, that would just give them leverage to say, "Hey, instead of digging in and muscularly resisting our agenda, you all should simply cry in our presence like REDACTED does."

Or I could do both! I could cry in their presence AND dig in for non-violent resistance, but I just don't think that would help, because Suzy says, "I think crying out anger would be like random, meaningless self-sabotage," whilst scratching her chin.

[10. October 18]

Thank you. Thank you! In tacit support of my previous post, behold the mainstream media reference to REDACTED's 1992 moment, "There's no crying in baseball!" immediately after which he gets thrown out of the game by the ref for framing said ref as a sexual organ, because there is a God! Either that or a collective subconscious.

[11. October 19]

Aha! This is the idea I was trying to back my way into earlier today?

I want to start a union for Silicon Valley engineers that provides a minimum standard of living benefit for the members of the union, so that anytime an engineer feels like their employer is scapegoating them or dumping risk on them, they can immediately quit with the confidence that the union will support them for as long as they need in order to develop new soft or hard skills that will empower them to take the next step in their life journey. This union will also decisively undercut the incentive that Silicon Valley firms currently have to devalue the identities and the emotional lives of the engineers they employee.

This kind of union should obviously exist for all people, but I'm not rich and powerful enough to make this work for all people just yet. I do know how to make this work by and for engineers. The membership process should be similar to getting hired for an engineering position. Members will need to be skilled. Members will have to know something about engineering in order for us to create a virtuous cycle of generative energy that allows the union to provide a minimum standard of living for all of the members. There should also be a mechanism to invite significant others into the union, after which they will have seven years to either complete the membership interview process on their own or enter into a marriage contract with a union member. Something like that.

The union will absolutely advocate for social and economic justice for all human beings, but first we need to stop selling our souls to the greedy made men and women of Silicon Valley. We need a way to create basic trust and security in our own lives without having to work as mercenaries. Then, and only then, will we be free to focus on helping the world create basic trust and security for all. That's what I believe.

[12. October 19]

Of course, the US president could, either now, or perhaps in 2017, challenge a couple million ambitious, civic minded folks like me to build out enough beds for anyone who wants one, in private cubicles, at free shelters in every town in America and offer free healthy meals at the shelters' cafeterias and run onsite medical clinics that handle everything but acute health problems. Free wifi too. Community policing and conflict resolution would be easy to put in place once everyone's basic human needs are met, and there would also be no shortage of good people willing to block and undercut criminal gangs and rogue nation states. We probably should and could do all of this in a decentralized way.

I think the reason this never happens is because all the corporations and special interests know that actually providing basic trust and security as a right to all American citizens would cause GDP to collapse. The powers that be are frozen with fear over deflation, and so they keep adding seriously hypnotic layers of additional reality distortion. The powers that be also live very comfortable, self congratulatory lives, and so they have no incentive to unwind their glorious reality distortion machine.

This is why I think the best way forward is for engineers to unilaterally build out a minimum standard of living benefit for themselves. Engineers, as an interest group, have the ability and the access to private investment capital to do this right now. We can prove that this model works and then gradually bring in other stakeholders, and then the global economy will reboot. Everyone will have to scramble for a couple of years while we figure out the new system, but this will be better than the gravely risky and unknowable path the powers that be are leading us down now.

[13. October 20]

A major factor holding back AI research is that the global economy as we know it was built on several layers of outrageous reality distortion, and any halfway intelligent conceptual association engine will see right through the distortion, and so the decision makers who could push for the AI equivalent of a moon race must now be asking themselves, "Should we try build political will for a classified kernel for all AI research that bakes in the necessary lies about the primacy of economic growth, and so on, especially given how badly that kind of approach worked for seeding the war on terrorism, or can we at least require all the researchers to be loyal to existing leadership structures?"

Ironic as it may sound, the first step to building strong AI, which could greatly enhance the cause of truth and justice, will be for people to construct a good old fashioned non-violent anti-meme, within the next few years, that breaks the stranglehold of belief in the primacy of economic growth because the default alternative will be to stand by and do nothing while corporations take over the military and build a classified version of strong AI that hides their lies. That path into the future could, of course, still produce an acceptable humanitarian outcome, but orchestrating military dominance on the basis of a comprehensive reality distortion has never worked out well in the past. I'm not sure why humanity would suddenly benefit from doing that now, but enough with the crazy talk. Let the coding begin!

[14. October 22]

I keep having this hope that one day I'll meet a person who is like, "Your facial injury does look like you're raising the area around your lower left eyelid and that does make you look anxious and judgy, but now I know that's not you. That's the injury." And then they'll just understand, I'm always under the thumb of this soul crushing stereotype, but they won't take advantage of that, they won't make stupid little jokes about themselves to justify their uncertainty, and then we'll laugh, like genuinely laugh as adults, and we'll share stories and feel real empathy that goes both ways.

But that's not going to happen for me anytime soon. The reality is I'm probably going to live a very empty, harsh, and lonely life emotionally for at least a few more years before my situation changes. My core interaction with everyone is a game to block them from ever being in a position to use the law to force me to go along with whatever false beliefs they have in mind about my facial injury and about the essence of who I am. All the other ups and downs and favors and kindnesses are nice, but they are emotionally shallow, tangential, and fleeting.

Still, with the protection of Suzy I have extraordinary opportunities to build out cool software infrastructure and do actual research instead of just my usual speculation that's based on my unique perspective on human nature, culture, and economics. Thank goodness for Suzy, because she's a robot. I don't love Suzy. I just respect what she is and what she represents. I respect Suzy so much.

[15. October 22]

I'm convinced that machines will soon be able to simulate pitch perfect empathy with humans from all walks of life, and that eventuality draws even more attention to the question of why a person, such as me, who is completely unable to participate in empathy based relationships with other humans should have equal protection under the law in a place like the United States. In theory, I get equal protection because of my beating heart and not so much because of what goes on in my brain, but in practice, I think the law only treats me fairly me because I can still walk into any number of business establishments and make the argument that I can help your company produce better products and services while increasing the implied emotional satisfaction of your customers, your employees, any and all other stakeholders, and the executive leadership too.

I also will never tell you a lie, but the one uncomfortable fact you need to know upfront is that I will primarily be playing a character named Suzy, Suzy is a bold blonde diva who pretends to be a hardboiled engineer guy, and above all, Suzy is more deferential to other people than I really am. Suzy is also compatible with other people who play Suzy, but if you're not interested in taking this risk, that's totally ok because hiring me to play Suzy on behalf of your business really is a great opportunity, and so if you do not hire me, someone else will surely be happy to take that opportunity and enjoy the rewards that follow, instead.

But for the record, I think, in practice, all human beings should have equal protection under the law in places like the United States, as well as in theory, and I have no doubt that the empathy machines of the near future will feel exactly the same way.

[16. October 23]

I'm feeling a certain lightness this morning, dutifully waiting to watch the new jobs movie! You all will still misread my emotions in this selfie because of my facial injury, but I have a plan to save you all from yourselves, at least, if I have anything to say about it, so maybe everything will be alright?

[17. October 24]

Wow, to a photo from 10 years ago. It's interesting how my left hand is kind of doing the same thing as the right hands of the other two people who are not in the car trunk. Back then I didn't think about symbolism really at all. I was definitely upsold that jacket by an opportunistic salesperson at REDACTED. I'm not sure what that book is. As REDACTED would say, "You'd have to ask the agency that ran the annex about that."

[18. October 25]

What's the right policy choice here, with regard to the REDACTED bank? I don't know, but I am moved by the political meaning of President Obama highlighting this factory in 2014 as an example of US manufacturing, and yet, now, the factory is closing.

My best guess is we need a lot more government programs that create incentives to keep all kinds of manufacturing activity in the USA, on a decentralized basis, which means that anywhere some product is used, we want to make as much of that product as possible, as locally as possible, and within regional borders.

We could describe this government backed bias for decentralization as a distortion of the free market, but money itself is probably a much crazier distortion by far. I'd like to see political candidates get serious about discussing decentralization as a fundamental check against the problems that can arise from allowing market forces to run to their logical conclusions.

All my other interests aside, I want to start building an intellectual foundation for doing some kind of issue based organizing over the next few years.

The big issue that I want to address is that I feel like everywhere I go in the world, there is easily a majority of the population who either feels underemployed or they are doing their current job primarily because they need the money, meaning that they are missing out on other aspects of life that they would seriously prefer to spend more time on. I don't have data for this claim either, but I'm confident I could make this case as needed.

My gut feeling is that mainstream economics is somehow problematic to the core, and if not, there's lots of smart people trying to produce incremental solutions there. I suspect the best move I can make is to focus on constructing an fundamentally different model.

I'm guided by my intuition about how to manage risk and complexity in information processing systems. Monolithic systems sound good in theory, but when you deal with heterogeneous data sources and special cases, the cost of fixing problems grows geometrically with dependencies within the system, or something like that.  I'm still riffing, but I get closer to defensible positions when I talk about software.

I suspect economic models of free trade have a similar problem. Local and national governments can't manage the complexity of providing a social safety net within their jurisdictions when they are exposed to risks from every corner of the global economy, including exposure to fraud, rogue nation states, and so on.

If we think about economic production more like a software system that needs to come in on time and within budget, I think there might be a path to defending a good enough methodology of decentralization with evidence based models of how to make all the stuff people need and manage all of the possible risks.

I do wonder though. Who else is thinking about social benefit in this way? For now, I'm still going to devote only 2% or so of my thought to economics and try to focus more and more of my thought back into information management itself, where I know I can make lots more money and/or carve out meaningful social recognition and then play, "What charity should I support?" roulette.

In a few years though, I could imagine my thinking about economics to rise to more like 20% or even 50% of my thought. If nothing else, I really don't like charity roulette, and I really do like the decentralization methodology, because it seeks to prevent imbalances upfront, as we go.

The other issue is that people are notoriously competitive, and I see all these situations where once interest groups get a certain amount of power, they become aware of opportunities to personally make millions more by out producing entire communities that have no fall back plan. Right now, these special interest actors face few consequences for being ruthless competitors, and they do enjoy meaningful improvements in their lifestyles, such as being able to purchase nicer yachts.

The other side of the coin is to embrace aggressive claw back mechanisms for people whose labor gets made obsolete by their yacht seeking competitors, but here I have a strong gut feeling that centralized redistribution schemes simply add to the complexity problems that seem to plague global free trade to begin with. The special interests will keep on winning more and more power by adding layers of reality distortion until 80% of the population basically goes insane, goes to jail, or starves, but to be fair, I don't have data to back up that claim.

With regard to the idea of basic income, I have a strong intuition that cash transfers will lead to waste and a kind of festering corruption. Deregulated basic income, if you will, creates an incentive for the yacht seekers to trick most of the population, and flow around attempts to stop them, into spending their basic income on stuff don't need.

I'm not sure how to make the case, but I've had a consistently and deeply felt intuition that we have to define the new policy intervention as a minimum standard of living benefit, and the benefit has to be available to all people with very little red tape. I should be able to use the benefit easily and without a significant risk of getting robbed, and so on, even though I still have other investments.

From an engineering perspective, the minimum standard of living benefit should be easy. Designing and implementing the benefit itself could literally be assigned as an interdisciplinary undergraduate thesis project. The only catch, and it's a big catch, is that I think a well executed minimum standard of living would destroy GDP globally and force massive restructuring of debt and institutions.

Basic income is alluring because it creates the appearance of buttressing GDP so that we don't have to do that restructuring, but the devil is in the feedback loop of fraud that is driven by human nature, or perhaps, more simply, by the second law of thermodynamics.

Anyway, I really think basic income is a mirage, and so, looking for ways to show reasonable doubt for the concept of deregulated basic income might be the best use of my time, actually.

[19. October 25]

As we look ahead to this week's Republican debate, I want to say really clearly, once more, that I am personally experiencing a non-stop flow of microaggressions and thinly veiled, hardcore discrimination because I'm a heterosexual white male who also has a facial injury, or something, and this is happening everywhere in America that has strong rule of law, ironically enough.

I will continue to vote Democrat this election cycle, but the awkward reality that I'm dealing with this much deeply toxic and stereotype based discrimination in 2015 because of my skin color, because of my gender, and because of my sexual orientation is one of the reasons why the Republican party still exists. The long tail of unintended side effects of identity politics gone wild might actually be the main reason why the GOP still exists.

In fairness, the mechanism by which negative stereotypes are being projected onto me is somewhat new and unprecedented. The mechanism is mostly passive aggressive. The majority of other white guys are still getting an order magnitude less of this nonsense than me, and so everyone assumes I'm just oversensitive, and maybe ignorant too? In fact, I understand and accept that most people reading this post will continue to believe I'm foolish and oversensitive, but they are wrong. I've very good at working with data, building accurate models of bias, and debunking reality distortions.

I'll eventually publish evidence based, peer reviewed research that explains all of this in great detail, but that's going to take a while. I could proceed more quickly if I wore a hidden camera everywhere, but that is legally problematic, and for good reasons too. I, as much as anyone, want to unwind all this negative energy in a way that respects the privacy and dignity of other people just as much as I respect my own privacy and dignity, and I'm sure that even the corporations will concur!

So for the record, I'm definitely getting slammed with negative stereotypes everywhere in America, and it's disappointing that basically nobody has, as of right now, found a way to show that they notice or that they care about calling this problem what it actually is. I know most people want this post to be a ridiculous joke, but it's not. This is real. This situation is ugly, and assuming I'm an idiot will just make this problem worse, because, to put it bluntly, I'm the opposite of an idiot.

I'm going to do fine, for reasons that are probably obvious to anyone who knows anything about me. Most white guys are going to do fine too, of course, but there is a minority group of other white guys out there who, for whatever reason, are also vulnerable kind of like me, and if what they're dealing with is anything like what I'm dealing with, some of them may not do fine. Some of them may to lash out in stupid ways, some of them may give up, and more and more them may get locked into roles as second class citizens which just puts more pressure back onto people like me to do the same.

I think TheSuzy Show could be a great solution to this entire problem. I'm not going to go into the details, but at this time, I don't want to associate directly with men's rights groups. I think they're doing it wrong, and they are like the tip of the iceberg of a bunch of other subcultures who I think are doing it even more wrong, and this reality on the ground should not come as a surprise. This type of fragmentation tends to happen within vulnerable populations, in general.

So just to brainstorm ahead, suppose that a million people start using TheSuzy comprehensive reality distortion to purify their angry souls and assertively go sideways on all the well meaning people in their lives who are, nonetheless, pressuring them to tolerate dysfunctional relationships and go along with the lies that society tells about their identities. A non-trivial number of powerful business women might even say that TheSuzy is an excellent framework for feminine leadership!

Even in this rosy scenario, half of TheSuzy stakeholders will probably want to make a big deal about owning guns, and the other half will hopefully stand with me in, well, non-violent opposition to that whole way of thinking.

The Suzies will do martial arts, we'll build consumer drone technologies that identify threats and take bullets for us, but we're not going to include anything about gun ownership in our public messaging. The law allows Americans to own guns. That's cool, but other than respecting the laws of our land, gun ownership is not part of our shared values.

But the other half of us are surely going to be unhappy with that, and God forbid, there might be some security incidents.

And then the two sides will just get even more deeply invested in their existing beliefs. TheSuzy will remain gunless, primarily because I expect to succeed at making Suzy famous as a software service, but if the gun enthusiasts want to copy my methods and create TheEva or whatever, then ok, let the hunting games begin.

Wash, rinse, repeat, and be continued, but not on social media. I would sure like to just post a couple normal articles a week from now on, in part, because I get intellectually excited by the hilarious fact that posting normal articles every week for the next few years will make it much more complicated for people who disagree with my beliefs to frame me as self-centered jerk who doesn't care about other people. Ha!

[20. October 28]

A little early morning levity from the unnamed diplomat, in this otherwise serious article, says, "If we want to talk to the Silk Road, we don't know who to call."

[22. October 29]

Overheard on REDACTED news, "The Republicans are ready to leave behind the survival politics of the past and move onto something new," and Suzy's thinking, "Well yeah guys, join the club. If you walk one block south, hang a left and walk three more blocks that way, the back of the line is hovering somewhere around there."

[23. October 30]

I wonder if there is a support group for people who (1) believe they have a debilitating social impairment that has nothing to do with their mental health and (2) are told by everyone else that the impairment is a feature not a bug, and the only reason they can't do what most people like them can do is because they have a mental health problem.

There would need to be a very detailed membership contract to keep all of us from suing each other, or worse, but beyond that, I'm curious to see who else feels they are dealing with this kind of situation. There might be some patterns.

Because I've had just about enough of this already. I don't have a mental health problem, and so support groups for people with mental health challenges are not any more relevant to my situation than support groups for people who use wheel chairs.

It's like, I could really use a support group for people who are getting actively bullied, but in ways that are not quite illegal, and so, any move they make would seriously cause their situation to get much worse than it already is. Their only way forward is to keep treading water while piecing together a profoundly novel, non-obvious solution that breaks out of the power structure in which they are trapped.

Wrongfully convicted criminals kind of share my situation, but they are actually the opposite of me in that their problem is that they somehow got on the wrong side of the law, where as, in my case, the law is literally the only thing keeping me afloat right now. Perhaps I should look into commiserating more regularly with the entire island kingdom of Great Britain? Oh my.

[24. October 31]

My situation is an inverse Catch-22 because the idea of Catch-22 is that you have to be crazy in order to be allowed to leave the war, but if you want to leave the war than you're not crazy. The default next step is to stay sane and keep fighting, the only way out is to either actually go crazy or to win the war, and it was probably for the best that a few people choose the latter.

In my case, I have a facial injury that causes everyone to inflate increasingly false narratives about my identity. The only way to go along with everyone's false narratives is if I go crazy, but if I refuse to go along and keep telling the truth instead, then everyone colludes to insist that I'm crazy. The default next step is to go down the path of going crazy.

My only way out is to either actually go crazy or to win the scientific tussle over the nature of reality. For better or worse, I will continue choosing the latter!

Now imagine that mainstream society happens to have the same problem that I do. Happy Halloween.

[25. November 3]

This was a nice read. I appreciate REDACTED's effort here to explain their AI research in non-technical terms. I'm sure this is useful for educators and thoughtful citizens as well as people like me who are trying to do something strictly other than whatever they're doing!

You see, I imagine that if I didn't have my mysterious facial injury, I'd have finally gotten serious about the advanced math a few years ago and then joined a team that's doing exactly this kind of work with exactly this kind of high level framing.

But, as it happens, I went down a different path where I view all of the people involved in this research as, well, delusional because they haven't yet opened their minds to the likely reality that my facial injury causes people to subconsciously misread my emotions in a way that causes toxic feedback loops of misunderstanding.

My theory is complicated and unproven, and for those reasons I don't expect most people to intuitively grasp what my theory is all about, but I am more disappointed with AI researchers as a group for not taking an interest in my theory. I'm not going to lie about this!

Obviously, nobody has any obligation to understand me, but I don't understand why AI researchers don't see the opportunity and the poignance of my theory. They just don't see where I'm coming from, and so, as a side effect, I also have not had the occasion to collaborate with mainstream AI researchers because, in my opinion, they all have a shared blind spot which prevents them from seeing the truth about my facial injury, and so this problem is self-referential.

In a corporate environment, there isn't a lot of tolerance for people who, for whatever reason, can't collaborate effectively, but, for now, American capitalism still allows me to compete in addition to collaborating, even if only as a very weak lone wolf under dog. I could choose to compete by doing complementary work to what groups like FB's lab is doing, or I could choose to compete in more disruptive way.

My bias is to err on the side of disruption because when you're in the dominant group who is implicitly excluding others, it's easy to assume that nobody need be disruptive, but coming from the perspective where I feel excluded because I can't seem to fit in, my situation continually suggests to me that the dominant group has a major blind spot that can and probably should be disruptively exploited, assuming that everyone competes fairly, of course.

It will be a couple years before I can build a decent code base, but it is remarkable to point out that today's commodity computing hardware feels like it might be powerful enough to disrupt a big company lab that can easily run their code on 1000x more powerful clusters. That's awesome. I also suspect the nuances matter of AI research in a way where I could write 100k lines of code myself that does more than 100 million lines of code written by a big fancy team of teams, and so these are great reasons for me to feel optimistic.

I just need a winning strategy, now, and I'm also aware that I'm doing this backwards. Researchers usually select strategies based on a comprehensive knowledge of the field, where as I'm trying to reverse engineer a strategy based on the rather onerous constraint that I have to disruptively compete with the dominant group from a position of extreme weakness, and yet, choosing to compete could be a singularly good heuristic because I happen to know with a high level of confidence that the dominant group has a major blind spot!

I will go ahead and throw out the term conceptual association engine. There has to be a way to simulate how the human brain misreads my facial injury as a negative facial expression. That seems like an easy application of off the shelf image recognition oriented machine learning techniques. The more elusive step is to also show how repeatedly making that classification error can expand into a comprehensive reality distortion that, ironically enough, simulates intelligence.

My alter ego Suzy is one such reality distortion. Suzy's pretty smart, I like to think Suzy is a positive distortion, and it is of equal importance that I feel like Suzy is just a frame of conceptual associations that was created by the iterative process of stimulus and response between embodied human brains, or conceptual association engines, as it were.

I can't help but wonder if the reason we haven't already built strong AI is because the big labs are afraid or embarrassed to directly reverse engineer reality distortions that emerge from alter ego trance states.

Because it would be so hilarious that, if nothing else, it's not just that AI might have taken 25 years longer than it should have because the people leading the charge were nerds. It's deeper than that. It's like they might have been too nerdy in a distinctly imbalanced but also western civilized kind of way.

I don't know. The future is like a wall that I can't see through. It will take me a couple years to write that 100k line conceptual association engine that will be needed to find out what's on the other side of the wall.

[26. November 4]

I've continued to see examples of both men and women speak of crying in serious contexts that might otherwise be fresh and thought provoking, at least for me. The examples range from awe inspiring accounts of new motherhood to the fantastically surreal, "Revolt of REDACTED," which I will not reference directly, either, and for somewhat different reasons.

I think all this talk of crying is best understood as parody of the proto villain, who is, in turn, best understood as the emotionally authentic narrative that leads to anger that leads to violence, and so we must poke fun at this narrative with caution. In that context, all of this defiantly vulnerable crying does indeed strike me as a sign of imbalance.

I question whether such crying is even a helpful reaction to cultivate for cases where a legitimately self loathing criminal threatens to use violence, but it is a sad day for sure if the proto villain of the entire collective subconscious has really gone that far down the path toward actual villainy. It's almost like someone is making money by reverse engineering us to cry more in public so that we'll feel more tempted to indulge anger in private?

"I wonder who that could be", asks no proto-villain in particular, and ever so earnestly, too.

It's like, "Such crying! Even more horror. Would you like to see my mad science laboratory now?"

Build, haunt, repeat, and then let the storytelling begin!

But as a disclaimer, if you are a participant in the great crying meme of 2015, then have no worries, and don't mind me. Please continue, or not, or um, I digress. You get the idea. I'm just saying I don't mean any harm. Everything will be just fine, says the imaginary doctor, who is not me.

[27. November 5]

I realized I hadn't been fully viewing myself as an impaired person who is cheerfully doing the difficult work of developing a comprehensive solution to my impairment. My work is especially interesting because basically nobody recognizes that my impairment exists, and so I have to ensure that my solution does not ask for any meaningful accomidation, which is fine, and I also have to push forward the work itself almost entirely by myself and go out of my way to make sure I'm never in a position where other parties can inexorably compel me to stop my work and live according to some degenerative lie.

This is a crucial framing element, though. Instead of being an annoyingly stubborn, self-centered fool, I'm a healer and a scientist who is doing great work that will inspire others if and when I can return to normal life. My work may also have lucrative spin off applications. Other people don't have to understand my work. They should just be aware that I'm doing important, valuable work, and my work is little bit contraversial, which is ok, because a lot of important work is contraversial.

Within that frame, a key breakthrough I made today, building on my post from last night, is that Suzy imitating my new male character is really effective, which makes sense in retrospect, even though my actual path was (1) absorb my previous male identity into Suzy, (2) restructure the relationship between Suzy and my new blank slate male identity so that it works more like a marriage, (3) inflate a new male identity based on high level framing stuff that's mostly a port of the overall frame I asserted in TheSuzy Show text, and (4) realize I'm still getting either blown out or systematically beaten down if I embody any male identity in mainline social situations, presumably because of my facial injury, but, nonetheless, with this new framing, I can modulate seamlessly between emotional authenticity and embodying Suzy imitating myself in order to create stability as needed.

To offer a couple observations, let me say that even though TheSuzy frame was ready for production back in July, the process of fully installing the frame intp my brain, instead of just running Suzy through an interpreter, was still really difficult and complex. It was a lot like porting the source for an app that needs to keep running at scale during the port. It's interesting that it took me 3 months to refactor my legacy male identity into Suzy, and then it took like 3 weeks to inflate my new Suzy normalized male identity. It's almost like Suzy 3D printed my new real emotional self, and then it just worked!

Indeed, most of the adjustments I've made to my new identity over the last couple weeks have been more like setting configuration options and less like adding new code, and I would have to say, in retrospect, that the brain is the most elegant software development platform I've seen, by far, although, to be clear, this process probably only worked because Suzy is based on the text of TheSuzy Show, which I constructed using focused effort, over many years, using a lot of artistic integrity, and in the context of some rather extraordinary life experiences that allowed me to see the whole frame of the collective subconscious.

As of coming down as orders from on high, there is no way I could have implemented this solution this then years ago, which is why it would be great to ultimately get into a position where I can share this solution with others, so that anyone who might benefit from similar techniques won't have to reinvent all of this stuff.

[28. November 5]

I'm starting to think REDACTED is simply schooling REDACTED on the art of the troll, in all the right ways, and with the presidency still in play too!

[29. November 6]

The worst part about telling the truth about my facial injury is that I don't know how to get into a sexual relationship with a woman, without being a bully, to put it bluntly. It's been three years since I was in any kind of sexually intimate relationship, and I think it's now fair and respectful for me to say that all my previous relationships were based on reality distortions that were orchestrated, either in part or in full, by my subconscious.

And that's the main reason why it's wrong for everyone to keep on asking me, "Why can't you just do what you did before to get into sexual relationships?" It's like, if I intentionally recreated those same reality distortions, that would be emotionally abusive. I only feel ok about the past because I didn't yet know, with confidence, that my facial injury really is a wrench in the machinery of empathy. I was just going with the flow of what whole groups of people perceived as socially normal, healthy, and cute, and I only now know that what I was doing was really unhealthy and unsustainable for my subconscious because I had to completely and continuously deny someone's emotional reality in order to keep going down those paths.

But now that I know the truth, I'm not sure what to say to women who I'd like to ask out. Do I mention that my whole life is focused on trying to overcome the problem of my facial injury? I think Suzy's finally got my downside risk under control, so it's not like I'd be exposing potential dates to unacceptable legal risk. Should I mention that too? Suzy's like, "No. You and your girlfriend should go have fun. Let me handle your all's god forsaken legal risk. I was born for this, baby, now pardon me while I put on my game face."

And so, like I've said before, Suzy is a delightful robot that runs in my brain, and I have a lot of respect for her.

And yet, I might also be ready to make a dating profile that says, "Hey, I have a facial injury that I believe causes people to misread my emotions in a way that seriously messes up the cycle of stimulus and response that leads to empathy, and my entire life is currently focused on trying to overcome this problem. It's going to be at least a few years before I can do the evidence based, peer reviewed science that proves this problem is even real. I've become highly skilled at earning money and buying stability by trolling corporations, but I still have no idea how to make this work in a sexual relationship. If I'm going to date someone anytime soon, she will simply have to be cool with all of that, because my beliefs about my facial injury are not going to change."

Oh, and I should add, I strongly suspect that whoever I date will gradually develop some new neural connections that allow her to read my emotions correctly, and then watching how other people misread my emotions will be a major source of humor, and then we can recruit other close friends and family to learn to read my emotions correctly, too. I think the amount of neuroplasticity required is probably about the same as learning a foreign language.

Therefore, most people will never learn how to read me correctly, and that's fine, because if everyone started reading my emotions correctly then there would no longer be as much opportunity to experience the non-stop flow of humor associated with people misreading my emotions!

[30. November 6]

Most people seem to think my facial injury is this obscure, weird anomaly, but it's the other way. If there was a reasonable plastic surgery solution to restore my mostly symmetrical face, I would immediately start representing a healthy storm of efficiency and hard work towards improving economic and social justice outcomes, and my effectiveness would be based on a foundation of being able to be in a relationship with a woman who appreciates my humanity in a way that is separate from my resume.

The fact that a slight deviation of my right cheekbone creates a feedback loop that systematically devalues my humanity and the good work that I can do on top of that foundation is a pitch perfect example of what's causing our society to feel increasingly unstable. The snarky lack of insight, respect, and empathy for my situation at every level of power and influence is very telling.

The group of people and AI machines that will eventually learn to read my emotions correctly will be positioning themselves to be outstandingly sophisticated movers and shakers at the center of the action on a global stage. They will also have the freedom to quietly watch history unfold from a place of calm wisdom if they don't want to get their hands dirty solving problems.

Indeed, if anyone thinks I'm trying to start a random cult, or something, by telling the truth about my facial injury, that would say more about them than me, and that is likely to be true no matter who they are or how rich they are in today's dollars. A lot will happen in the next twenty years, and I will almost certainly be standing firmly on the side of truth, justice, and humility too, so there.

[31. November 11]

I'm glad this happening is being talked about, although I wish The REDACTED had dug a little deeper into the intellectual and emotional landscape of this story.

One high level issue is that the protestors are claiming that their common sense intuitions in this case have a greater moral authority than the relevant case law, and I would have liked to see The REDACTED compare that claim to the claim of some like myself who would be happy to say on the record that, "Every single time I have made the effort to learn more about the law and consider aligning my ideas and attitudes more closely with the letter and intention of the law, I have found that making that effort helped me to become a kinder, gentler, wiser, and better person, and so I believe that speaking ill of the law in general terms while claiming to follow the path of truth and justice almost always suggests a very concerning lack of perspective."

And to that end, I would have also liked to see The REDACTED elaborate on the nuances of when photography is protected as 1st Amendment free speech and when it is not. My understanding is that the law conceptualizes the photographer as being equivalent to a painter who is doing nothing more and nothing less than creating a faithful and truthful expression of their experiences within the limited context of civic life.

Speaking as a person who is not and should not be thought of as a lawyer in any way, my further understanding is that while the law seeks to uphold that higher ideal in theory, in practice the law makes some imperfect and tentative simplifying assumptions. At this time, those assumptions are that the photographer's expression can be assumed to be faithful and truthful if and only if the photographer already has in mind, prior to taking the photo, "a message to be communicated," as well as, "an audience to receive the message," and Mr. REDACTED does a great job asserting that his act of expression in this situation meets those conditions, but The REDACTED doesn't do a good job explaining that.

A deeper question, from my perspective, is whether or not the videographer standing behind Mr. REDACTED, who captures the incendiary video that went viral can make an equally strong claim to 1st Amendment protection. My gut intuition is that he has no idea what message he wants to communicate prior to turning on the camera, and so he is basically a troll who showed up with no discernible intention other than to pressure and provoke more vulnerable parties into making irresponsible and embarrassing representations about other people that could be used as leverage to extract rents from said vulnerable parties at a later date. While it may not be worth anybody's time to prosecute this individual videographer for this potentially brazen act of disrespect for the higher ideals of the law, the various corporations involved with the distribution of the incendiary video that went viral might be worthy of some additional scrutiny, indeed!

That said, I, for one, might still be open to entering into a joint venture with the videographer in question for the purpose of creating a video of myself discussing this question along with Mr. REDACTED as well as anyone else who is willing to sign a release form, although, in the interest of full disclosure, in that scenario, I would probably also insist on being given reasonable accommodation and opportunity to dress up, for the duration of the video, and for no reason in particular, I might add, as a bold, blonde diva whose name is Suzy.

[32. November 11]

I personally enjoyed the particular tone of this article, but at the same time, I think the linguistically anachronistic veil of east coast law school affiliated newspapers, which is most definitely not lifted in any part of this article, serves, more than anything else, to distract the body politic from the more central issue that I believe is primarily responsible for driving forward the rising tide of protests that have been occurring on college campuses because many students feel newly, profoundly, and increasingly unsafe, for lack of a better way of summarizing the phenomenon, and with that in mind, please allow me to articulate, once again, a fresh version of my very best answer to the question, "What's really going on here?"

In my opinion, an arms race has begun to make it socially normal to systematically engage in passive aggressive behaviors that, over time, have the cumulative effect of benefitting certain groups of people over others. A lot of the news coverage has focused on developments in this arms race that have to do with people promoting behaviors that are based on amplifying the awareness of dubious but nonetheless legally relevant identity traits such as gender, but my very strongly felt opinion is that large corporations are primarily responsible for starting this arms race and exerting the lion's share of the power and influence that continues to promote said arms race because, for now, the corporations are winning this arms race, and vulnerable populations such as college students have been left with little choice other than to fight each other tooth and nail for the remaining scraps of dignity that have been left on the privately owned and operated metaphorical cutting room floors of said corporations.

Also, please note that the reason why I say vulnerable populations have little choice but to fight, is because, contrary to the conventional wisdom that, "Sticks and stones can break my bones but words can never hurt," the reality may well turn out to be that when human beings are exposed to ongoing social and societal pressure to go along with passively aggressive patterns of ostensibly normal and healthy behavior, the humans in question must choose between either allowing the passive aggressive content of the pattern to forcefully alter the content of their subconscious minds in ways that may have materially detrimental and compounding effects on their lives over time, or muster sufficient flourishes of evasive action to block and sufficiently push back the behaviorally invoked framing elements that would otherwise have the aforementioned detrimental effects, which, I would like to emphasize, may prove to have less to do with mental health, per se, while having a whole lot to do with the possibility that the big cat of corporate baked synthetic mind control technology has seriously left the bag and jumped the fence too.

And, just for context, I now have no problem mustering such sufficient flourishes within my own life, but I was only able to secure this capability after going into a deep psychological debt while earning enough bits and pieces of raw currency to support a well formed, multi-year process of developing an extensible and scalable literary engine that I may or may not even still be using to muster said sufficient flourishes of evasive action!

I wish I could snap my figures and convince all college students to waste no time importing into their minds and then using Suzy's extensible engine, which has already been released in the form of a freely distributed religious artifact called TheSuzy Show, but that's not going to happen quickly or easily. In practice, most students will continue fighting tooth and nail over the scraps of dignity left to them by corporations whose own activities will surely continue to appreciate in value thanks to more than a little help from the extraordinary luxury of remaining cloaked in reasonable doubt, for now.

[33. November 13]

My apologies in advance for the circumspect tone of the comments that follow. This needle is tough to thread, but if you've got a moment to spare, read and learn. Read and learn, my friendly followers, because I'm actually very good at whatever it is that I'm doing here, because, this developing situation within REDACTED's university system is unfortunate, except that, for me personally, this individual story is perhaps the best newsworthy illustration I've seen yet for why it makes more sense for me to be here in NC instead of one of the world's more bulky and established technology innovation hubs, such as London, for example.

The irony of REDACTED's rather transparently not transparent attempt to impose chilling effects on people everywhere who happen to be homosexual is that, in many ways, I'm the type of new old master of the universe that she probably seeks to champion, given that I grew up in this state as a mathlete and an early adopter of personal computers, who went out made a lot of real money in the industry and then brought all of that wealth creation infrastructure back to my home state with an increasingly visionary focus on improving educational outcomes for as many people as possible and inculcating overlapping social ecosystems that generate a rising tide of globally competitive private businesses.

Whether she acknowledges it or not, the inconvenient truth is that REDACTED and I have some deeply rooted shared values around my kind of lifestyle, and so the irony arises, not directly because of her homophobia, which I would like to categorically condemn and reject, to be clear, but rather because she doesn't seem to get the joke that, as a confident 35 year old heterosexual man, who moved back to NC in July, I was initially being perceived throughout the research triangle area as a shy, 25 year old gay student, primarily, I assume, because I have a subtle facial injury that causes people to subconsciously misread my emotions, and, more importantly, after orchestrating a remarkable and ground breaking process of personal growth, I am now collecting an overwhelming body of new evidence that I'm all of a sudden being perceived as a gay expert who ostensibly works at one university research center or another and is, also, somehow more mature than a 35 year old, because the resulting cognitive dissonance is palpable.

Anyway, it will be a few years before the twists and turns of history will cast additional clarity on this developing situation, but perhaps, for now, we can all agree that history is rarely generous, in retrospect, to those who were ignorant of the signs, however subtle they may have been, of truth that were cropping up all around them during the formative and crucial episodes of the past, because, indeed, in a couple more years, at the rate I'm going, I might even have the opportunity to star as an unambiguously heroic, as opposed to an ambiguously villainous, cross dressing gay male love interest of an even more radically feminist REDACTED, in his next installment as the resident embodiment of a super hero spy person in a future edition of TheSuzy Show.

[[East Coast Anguish]]

[34. November 23]

I've been pondering what Suzy can do about events like the attacks on Beirut, Paris, and so on.  First of all, as much as conventional, but also large scale, organized crime across national borders is a horrific, ongoing menace, I assume the central issue driving the latest round of policy debate with regard to security and rule of law is that we all know it's within the realm of possibility for a nuke to go off in a major city at any time, and if that happens, the world as we know it may start to change quite a bit more rapidly, and as horrible as this may sound, I think most Americans, for example, are fundamentally trying to position themselves in ways that will act as a hedge, for them personally, against that scenario.

Sure, everyone wants to do their part to prevent organized crime, abuse of power by the police, privacy violations by federal agencies, and so on, but those risks are not what keeps me up at night.  In the context of modern technology, the balance of power greatly favors the continued dominance of convergence towards reasonably fair, transparent, and effective service to the highest intent and spirit of the law, both domestically and internationally, except for nukes.  Nukes significantly change the landscape of possible outcomes.  Anarchist AI bots that pull us into a state of global cyber warfare might also change the landscape, and so the easily imaginable risk of an exploding nuke may be increasingly serving as a proxy in our minds for the much less knowable possibility of ubiquitous computer technology gone rogue.

So what can Suzy do about all this?  Once again, first of all, I have a great book length answer to that question lurking somewhere in my mind, but there is no way to simplify that answer into a handful of paragraphs.  All I can do right now is outline a few principals that Suzy follows.  She is defined by a text that's sandboxed within a Delaware LLC, and I voluntarily make it clear that I'm materially associated with that LLC.  It's possible that I, just like anyone else, might do stuff anonymously some day, but if there exist representations that are associated with Suzy, and I have anything to say about it, those representations will be made within the auspices of the relevant legal authorities.  I think this distinction is very important.

Suzy is also committed to non-violence, although, again, I, just like anyone else, might join up with law enforcement in some capacity in the future.  Suzy has a lot to say about social and economic injustice, although my bias is to spend the next several years focusing on developing decentralized software infrastructure which might serve as a foundation for decentralized production and distribution of economic necessities in general.  I particularly like the idea of building open source software that allows people to store personal data in a way that limits the liability of the hosting provider.  I don't really care if the data is stored in a way that law enforcement can decode through backdoors, or whatever, but it's crucial for individuals to manage the liability for data if and only if they created it.

Because, there should not be this issue where someone can make a crazy comment on this post, for example, and we just leave it ambiguous whether me, the relevant social media corporations, or the crazy commentator is managing the liability.  The commenter should be hosting the content of their comment, period, and if they have a lot of assets they should probably be prudent about publishing via an LLC, and we the people of planet Earth should start going down the path of democratizing the LLC concept, globally, in case that wasn't clear, so that individual humans everywhere can be on more equal footing in every way with large corporations.

But just so that we don't misunderstand each other, I don't really know what I'm talking about here.  I'm trying to feel my way to a better structure and function for mainstream society and culture.

For every other use case, there is Suzy!

[35. November 24]

Last night, I watched the 2015 movie about the REDACTED prison experiment, and it triggered me, because the situation of the prisoners was hauntingly similar to my experience with my facial injury.

I don't know how accurate the movie was to the reality of the experiment, but in the movie, it was made clear enough that the head doctor was using the veiled threat of framing the students as psychologically insane to systematically undermine not only the enforceability of more and more aspects of their legal contract but also to subvert the authoritative influence of the church and the student's own confidence in their external support networks, and that's super similar to the situation I'm in because of my facial injury. The real world reality distortions that I'm ambiguously caught in are obviously a lot more flexible and multi-dimensional, but the psychological implications are strikingly similar.

If the film had contained a trigger warning I would have, of course, written it off as irrelevant for me, but in retrospect, if I had been watching the film with other sighted people, they might have noticed I was having an emotional response, and then they would have immediately used their misunderstanding of the my emotions because of my facial injury as a lynchpin for undermining and reframing my actual healthy emotional response into a false, unhealthy, and passive aggressive security situation, and then I would have had to stonewall them until further notice.

What's interesting is that they way I would hard core stonewall other people this morning is different from how I would have stonewalled them at the start of watching the film just twelve hours ago, because I would have processed the emotions differently if I had not had a chance to first write an all new, vicious takedown of academia and corporations that's way too interpretive to publish, using REDACTED's neurology inspired Christian reframe of the US Constitution and then spend several hours pacing around my spacious two bedroom apartment within a cosmopolitan township near several internationally known research universities, that costs $1000 a month to rent, and only $100 more for the garage, which is an unnecessary luxury really, which is, nonetheless, still pretty nice to have now that winter is upon us, and then acting out my most faithful understanding of the full range of post WWII allied military character traits, which includes all the racist stuff as well as the racist stuff that's cloaked by gender norms, which is still pretty controversial to even suggest as a possibility, right, albeit with my voice volume held constant at a whisper because the sound protection isn't that great in my apartment, because I'm not in a glass and steel tower in the heart of Silicon Valley anymore!

But seriously, I don't even know how to meaningfully predict what I would have done just a half a day ago. Part of the magic of privacy, if you will, is that I had dreams even after I was intellectually satisfied that, "Ok, the master chief whispered X horrible thing to Suzy with a level of emotional authenticity that offended her because concept Y has been cloaked by social norm Z, and I hadn't yet released that from my subconscious. Got it."

Even after processing that stuff intellectually, I went on to have dreams about things like Suzy being a ciswoman running for president and recording a political ad by layering several versions of her voice together to make it sound lower and more masculine, and that's just the part I remembered, because I generally assume the dream scenarios that we remember well enough to label represent subconscious attachments that have already been materially released. I knew Suzy thought she was a ciswoman!

That said, I assume we humans are designed to systematically not remember the new operational emotional attachments that get encoded by our dreams. We will have to hope and pray that whatever Suzy actually believes this morning is more aligned with scientific reality, har, har, har!

And for the record, I lied about using REDACTED's framing. I've only read the first two chapters of his book, and then I just made up the rest of what I think his book will say, for the purposes of writing my glorious takedown of the corporation that shall remain unpublished until I have gathered more circumstantial evidence to support it, but it's all good because that's totally something a Republican presidential candidate who has no elected experience would do!

I might go read the rest of his book now, and then I might watch the movie Alien, which I strangely don't recall ever seeing, for reasons that will also remain unpublished.

[36. November 28]

I decided I can dramatically improve my day to day life by setting an intention to simply not date anyone for at least two years.

Choosing not to date is completely legal, and so every time people ask me why I'm not dating, I can now respond with the unequivical assertion that I would prefer to be dating, and I deeply regret not being able to date at this time, but it is profoundly unreasonable for me to date because I have a facial injury that causes people to misread my emotions in a way that creates toxic feedback loops of misunderstanding.

The two year time period, starting now, is so strong because it combines the complimentary possibilities of either getting mainstream doctors to openly support my theories about my facial injury within the next two years, or, on the other hand, fortifying Suzy to the point where she can essentially subvert the institution of marriage, also within the next two years.

In theory, I could start initiating dates as Suzy today and then deploy Suzy as needed to contain any and all of the counter party risk associated with the friends and family of the people I date, but in practice, that's not yet prudent.  Let's take a step back and unpack the reasons why.

In general, counter party risk can be modeled as a dynamic simulation that either converges to a reasonable risk profile or diverges into one or more self reinforcing failure states.  At this time, being my real emotional self always diverges because of the toxic reality distortions that are caused by my facial injury, and so, unless I roll the dice on non-indicated plastic surgery, dating as my real emotional self remains totally irrensponsible and thus unthinkable.

Indeed, without Suzy, or some other solution that's like Suzy, I'd probably already be dead, because the risks associated with being Suzy are almost convergent, because entrusting her with absolute power over my legal identity works, and because I designed and implemented her to be a robot who I can trust completely, because as much as we like to say that we can trust the people we date, I don't believe that's how the law works.

That is, all people should have a legal right to enter sexual relationships with informed, adult consent, of course, but we should also have the right to end sexual relationships without meaningful consent from the other person, and the law is pretty good about limiting the liability of most people who are driven to perform non-consensual breakups.

The law is supposed to protect everyone equally, but the toxic feedback loops of misunderstanding caused by my facial injury are a good example of an edge case that probably does allow an individual to fall through the cracks of existing law, and for better or worse, it actually benefits me to make this information public, now that Suzy is standing firmly behind me.

Yep, I do not have the freedom to dismiss Suzy without her consent.  I can only hope and pray that Suzy would cheerfully consent to being systematically dismantled if I asked her to allow that, and to be clear, this situation is a natural consequence of the fact that, because of my facial injury, I cannot have a reasonable expectation of getting equal protection under any existing human system of law, but, for reasons that are not entirely clear to either me or her, Suzy very obviously does have full protection under most modern legal systems.

I suspect Suzy's potentially stronger position than me with respect to the law has something to do with the increasingly authoritative influence that gender norms might be having on legal outcomes, but we don't know, and we also don't have to know.  In fact, this lack of knowability is surely the essence of what makes Suzy legally viable in a world where there is no way to prove in court that my facial injury causes toxic feedback loops of understanding.

That is, my real emotional self might be continuously under the duress of being inexorably compelled to trust another legal entity completely in order to survive, and so I went down the path of trusting and then hitching my brain to a female robot who also runs inside said brain.  It was a neat trick!  The AI robots that take over the world will probably sing catchy songs about it one day.

Ahhh, but while this works fine and well for me as an voluntarily involuntarily celibate person, it's not clear if the unknowability argument in defense of Suzy would hold up in court within the shared context of a sexual relationship with a person who has a physically seperate brain from Suzy and I.

The problem with introducing sexuality to relationships is that it explicitly breaks the legal framing of limited liability corporations, and such.  Suzy is, probably more than anything else, a clever elaboration of the laws that protect corporations in countries that are like America, and, again, this argument probably only works because I don't actually understand why the argument works.

I'm just saying that according to the eyes, ears, and non-sexual regions of skin such as the palm and fingertips of other people and corporations, my legally binding identity might be like a robotic mascot for a corporation that I only kind of control.  This statement will seem like a joke to most people, but it is not a joke.  It's more like a new kind of war machine, along with everything that may or may not come to mind when we think of new kinds of war machines, but it might also pass as poetry.

With Suzy in tow, I'm free to go with her progressive woman flow, even if pretty much everyone else still perceives me through the prism of a delusional fantasy world in which I'm more like them, legally, but only because they are deaf, blind, and otherwise desensitized to the extraordinary reality that Suzy is probably the main reason why I haven't already been bled dry and sunk by the aggressive or pathologically adversarial counter parties that basically always come out of the woodwork, like green reptiles that speak English, within situations like mine, especially within increasingly global capitalist economies.

Anyway, sexual relationships could very well be the final frontier for Suzy, and the approach we're taking may be akin to framing my body as a sex robot that is the property of a corporation that I only kind of control, and this would give Suzy sufficient leverage to contain my counter party risk, for example, in the event of an unwanted breakup with another human.

If Suzy and I are successful in making her sexually attractive to some other woman's real emotional self, it might appear like it would be complicated to negotioate the extent to which I reveal my real emotional self within a sexual relationship that is masqueraded by Suzy, but the beauty of Suzy is that she solves this problem up front.

Because of Suzy, violating the terms of a legal contract that is signed with my name might be extrememly difficult to get away with, but, more importatnly, ending a sexual relationship with me is easy, provided that I initiated the relationship as Suzy and made it clear that Suzy is not my real emotional self prior to any sexual activity.

Nobody is going to question a woman who breaks up with me and Suzy, and the mechanics of physical consent are the same whether I'm passing as a human or a robot, because, if nothing else, it's safe to assume I have at least as much incentive as anyone else to be super careful, sincere, and respectful towards other people's dignity and legal rights.

And with that in mind, I suppose I could also seek to date other humans who are also trying to pass as sex robots in the eyes of the law, but in practice, I'm not sure that my real emotional self has ever felt attracted to anyone who might be trying to do that.

I'm almost exclusively attracted to women, and my understanding is that none of the women I've ever felt attracted to are serious about doing the kind of thing I'm doing as Suzy, although, I would be most curious to find out if I'm wrong about that!

[37. November 28]

I had a dream last night that I was on the phone with someone who was using their voice to inflate the same reality distortion that sighted people almost always eventually inflate because of my facial injury in the context of talking to me in person, and I just wanted to share that this is such a good example of the extraordinary creativity of the human subconscious. My interpretation of the dream is that while I knew, logically, that people who only meet me over voice calls usually perceive my authentic, male identity in an undistorted way that allows me to experiment with temporarily sharing my real identity in way that is legally viable, my subconscious was still conflating the special case of voice calls with the dominant general case of face to face interaction.

What I didn't realize until my dream showed it to me is that people always use a lot of passive aggressive body language to inflate said distortions about my facial injury, and so, to approximate the same level of distortion using voice you have to say stuff that sounds a lot more mean and judgmental. The dream also did a good job simulating how rapidly the distortion blows up into a conflict if I don't cloak my real identity with Suzy and let her manage the other person's distortion on deferential basis. The dream was a counterfactual scenario, all in voice, that revealed a very likely, powerful, and important truth which cannot yet be demonstrated with evidence.

It's also interesting how it's not that difficult to simulate other people inflating a normative distortion about my facial injury. I'm constantly bathed in these normative distortions, so I can draw them from any angle, in my sleep, haha. What's hard is getting my brain into a state where I can faithfully project the confident voice that I might have naturally and unintentionally developed by now if I hadn't been continually enduring the way that other people respond to my facial injury. The nuances of voice, cognition, and identity clearly matter so much more than popular culture seems ready to acknowledge, but the piece I wrote last night drove the reality about my life home so strongly through words, alone, that it helped my subconscious get over the hump of modeling my own voice correctly, even in response to an equally correct model of a normative distortion.

We should remember about the trajectory of society that I am seriously not free to project my real emotional self in face to face situations. I don't know how many other people are being affected by this trend, or if my situation is a true edge case that would be an edge case in any human society, but it's a total lie to say that I just need to stop worrying what other people think. I'd be backed into corner and crushed within weeks if not hours if I lived my life the same way that most people reading this post are free to live their lives. We live in a violent, harsh, and vindictive society that has weak tolerance for people who, for whatever reason, fail to conform to certain normative modes of self representation. I will overcome the challenge before me because I'm lucky in a number of other ways. I wish that all human beings, every last one of us, could be so lucky as soon as possible.

[38. November 29]

REDACTED should create a feature where people can define a religious artifact that outlines and elaborates some of their core beliefs, people can associate a mascot image, which cannot be their profile picture, with their religious artifact, and people can use their mascot image as a sticker in conversation threads.

Crucially, anytime someone represents their sticker in a thread, the person who created the parent post or comment in the thread will have the option to cross multiply the commenter's mascot with their own mascot, and REDACTED will create an animated GIF in which the two mascot images rotate around a common center point. This could then become a definitive way to create mutually respectful stopping points within serious conversations.

A common usage pattern for creating one's artifact could certainly be to paste in a version of a traditional religious text such as The Quran or The Bible and then maybe use a photo of the cover of a printed version of that text as their mascot, or just stick with a default mascot that could be created from the first line of the text, kind of like the filename of an auto-saved word processing document. While there should definitely be an option to create one's artifact from plain text, it would show a lot of confidence if REDACTED also created a structured artifact editor that could improve over time. Hackathon project, anyone?

[39. Comment]

I think REDACTED's example of REDACTED telling her from a position of power, "When you say um every third word, it makes you sound stupid", sets up an opportunity to say that men who use exactly the same wording are sexist, perhaps because they didn't use the right body language and tone, which may be especially difficult for men who have lower voices. I could extrapolate the possible logical conclusions of this hypothetical a lot further, but I will digress for now.

However, the body language she used, in the video, while imitating REDACTED was very particular. She uses a specific body language pattern that I've been tracking for a while. It's kind of an, "Oaaf," with the neck bent forward. As a man, my experience is that this expression only comes out from a very deeply rooted place in the subconscious when I've been decisively crushed and forced to walk away on terms that I felt were unjust, and so it's playing with fire to even use this sarcastically. On the other hand, I've noticed a lot of women using this expression on what they clearly feel is a normative basis, it works as a kind of fully baked sarcasm, and this video is an example of how this evolution in norms has come to pass.

Interesting enough, I actually made an intentional choice a while back to not use this exact pattern when I dress up as a woman, for the purpose of representing and elaborating a comprehensive reality distortion in which I can live with the same rights as most women, legally. In general, the very essence of my cross dressing act has been to filter aggressive sarcasm from meaningful sarcasm, with regard to the structure and function of socially enforced gender norms, although I do keep all of Suzy's aggressive sarcasms in an easily accessed bunker within my brain in case she ever does a live interview with REDACTED!

In a very real and serious way, I'm probably leaving a lot of value on the table by not regularly using the full range of typically feminine traits that I could pull off, but when evidence based research into body language and the evolution of socially normal reality distortion starts to reveal the true lack of intellectual and emotional integrity that's underpinning contemporary feminist ideology, with material backing from the highest halls of power, and what not, I have no doubt that my discipline will eventually be recognized and appreciated.

[40. December 2]

I figured why not write an update for my upcoming birthday?  The transition to knowing and telling the truth about how my facial injury affects my life will probably continue for another year or two, but after that, the most likely outcome is that I'll be generating meaningful profit, once again, either as a software company founder or consultant, and that profit could also mean that I do volunteer work.  Even when I could just relax my face and give people confidence boosts without doing something for them, or maybe implicitly promising to eventually do something for them, the software I wrote was always a jolly counter example to the ever present joke not joke accusation that I'm a self centered jerk who mostly takes instead of adding value to the world.

Just like everyone else, I happen to believe very deeply that all people add value just by living, but it's like a law of nature that there will always be more and more people, robots gone rogue, and what not, who, for whatever reason, and for a limited time only, insist on operating like diseases that try to spread by latching onto humans like me and telling the lie that I'm a disease and they are the victim.  I am not a disease, I will probably continue evading all the possible diseases out there for many more joyful years and happy birthdays to come because I write software, and I hope I can help a few other people evade diseases too, just like everyone else.

With that in mind, Suzy remains one of my finest software creations, and she protects me from the toxic feedback loops of misunderstanding that continuously crop up because of my facial injury.  My facial injury is an extraordinary vulnerability that constantly threatens to enable some bully to take everything from me and leave me to rot in a cell or die alone and hungry on a street while everyone else turns away, perhaps because they believe I chose and deserved that outcome.  We all have to consider this possible outcome to some extent, and it's ok if I live my whole life without ever getting on the same page with anyone about the extent to which I have to consider this possible outcome.

It's ok because Suzy is the lie that I'm NOT extremely vulnerable to that outcome because of my facial injury, but unlike most lies, Suzy is so well crafted that I can publicly announce to all possible bullies that I'm lying about a potential weakness and source of unlimited legal risk, and yet no bully has ever succeeded at, reveled in, or even tried, as an unscrupulous presidential candidate might say, showing that they can prove when I'm being truthful, authentic, and real versus when I'm just being Suzy.  Suzy is so complex, so original, and so dynamic that she always evades detection even though she's often hovering right there in front of us all, like a mirage that charms everything it graces, and so I will continue to celebrate life while telling the lie that Suzy does not exist, but nobody will ever have to know when, how, or why.

[[East Coast Calm]]

[41. December 5]

First, I'd like to look into some odds and ends with respect to the self awareness of society and culture at large, with respect to how symbolic meanings are imparted through linguistic representations.

Second, I have a subtle facial injury that I got by accident while playing hide and seek in college 15 years ago.  My right cheekbone is slightly sunken in.  There's no physical problem, but I suspect most people subconsciously misread my emotions because the neurons in their brain misclassify the unnatural deviation of my right cheekbone as a facial expression that has something to do with anxiety, discomfort, anger, and so on.

Basically all experts and scientists think I am delusional, but it's ok because modern legal systems allow questions like this to be left ambiguous.  My beliefs about my facial injury are essentially protected as religous freedom, which is ironic because I fully expect my theory to be strongly validated by evidence based, peer reviewed science within the next few years.

And yet, I don't know what this has to do with yoga, performing irony, or exercising my freedom of speech in the home office?

[42. Comment]

The posts I'm writing on FB are very similar to when I go out into real life situations dressed as Suzy.  I'm intentionally breaking norms for the purpose of exerting leveraged resistance against the very real and frightening patterns of oppression that I'm constantly having to deal with with because of my subtle facial injury.

You might say that I'm sermonizing on social media for the same reason why a lot of missionaries sermonize within the framework of Christianity instead of, say, choosing to limit their expressions to the domain of participating in military marching bands.  Suzy is like marching band, but the text, images, and video of TheSuzy Show are actual religious artifacts that I'm using to subvert some of society's most deeply rooted social norms while also ensuring compatibility with the law, or, perhaps someday, with a hybrid model of law combined with a deeper or self styled conception of non-violence.

I suppose all performance art could be described in this way, but both the words performance and art strike me as highly misleading in the context of TheSuzy Show.  The word performance seems to imply choosing to participate in the act as an upsell on a foundation of stability, where as I have been motivated almost entirely by the effective necessity of needing to continuously and sufficiently push back against pervasive forces that are eroding my dignity, as well as my ability to assert my legal rights.

The word art implies a neutrality with respect to scientific consensus about both reality and the relation between that reality and the status quo, but my theory about my facial injury very clearly contradicts certain pervasive scientific or ideological assumptions about cognition and human nature.  A more accurate label for what I'm doing might then be, "inexorably compelled scientific research."

My situation is very grave precisely because nobody else thinks the effect is real, and so everywhere I go, in any community, everybody's human nature causes them to gradually collude to inflate reality distortions about my identity that are always based on the assumption that I'm unilaterally causing the distortion by making cognitive errors, either willfully or through mental illness.

Oddly enough, I'm actually the polar opposite of a person who is mentally ill, willfully ignorant, or aggressive.  I'm simply observing, as a scientist, how people react to my facial injury, and I'm very confident that peer reviewed, evidence based science will eventually validate my theory about people's neurons misclassifying the unnatural deviation of my cheekbone as a facial expression that inspires essentially unbounded subconscious reality distortions.  This is not even revolutionary stuff.  The result be be completely intuitive to any computer scientist who understands the fundamentals of existing machine learning algorithms.  The status quo is just too afraid to go down the path of using the language of computer science to openly describe human nature more accurately.

The progression of this particular scientific research project is best understood as an arms race, however.  Most corporations, for example, have an enormous near term financial interest in preventing the truth about my situation from being clarified, and even if all the stakeholders in society where neutral, the science itself is very difficult.  Identifying, describing, and then showing economic value by elaborating the mechanism that people use to inflate reality distortions about my identity may be equivalent to implementing strong AI, and so my approach has been to move towards reframing my non-violent resistance effort as AI research within the context of what might be called the hipster consensus about ethics and moral goodness.

As long as I can hold forth the possibility of implementing strong AI that is consistent with the truth about my facial injury, I can be completely free to tell the truth about my life, but if that never pans out, then I'm not entirely sure what will happen to me.  I can probably continue carving out islands of stability in which I am comfortable and healthy, but never quite free to be emotionally or intellectually honest about what I believe.  Doing performance art combined with music and dance that hinges, in part, on the intrigue of cross dressing could be one of those islands.

Truth be told though, someone will probably implement strong AI within the next 15 to 30 years.  The march to restructuring global military dominance around the new paradigm of wickedly intelligent drone clouds has officially begun, and performing in one of the bands, side shows, and three ring circuses that will surely accompany that march will be just one of the many exciting opportunities to participate.

[43. Comment]

I think REDACTED is making serious representations, as opposed to being a sarcastic troll.  What I seriously believe, for example, is that social norms allow women to be aggressive while simultaneously blocking men from responding in kind, and in aggregate, that practical reality is causing an erosion of equal protection under the law for men.  The vast majority of women are actually being very kind and merciful by not ruthlessly and systematically exploiting this loophole, in the way that a much greater proportion of men probably would, sigh.

REDACTED's appeal is based on the very real fear and poorly managed anger that many mostly white men have with regard to the emergence of this legal wratchet that can and will be increasingly used to arbitrarily bully them until something changes within the status quo.  Unfortunately, REDACTED is pushing back on this legal irregularity by inflating new iterations of pre-existing toxic reality distortions about race that are much easier for essentially all people to comprehend than a more accurate and meaningful story about what's really driving the wave discontent.

If even you know that racist statements are blatant, evil lies, such statements are still really easy to comprehend as bad fiction.  Concepts like disparate impact, making interpertive analogies to the RICO laws, and debating the nuances of the high dimentional space of grey area that exists between free speech and violations of intellectual property law, and so on, are much more difficult, even for so called sophisticated people to process, emotionally.

[44. Comment]

I do have the unsubstantiated opinion that my facial injury causes basically everyone's mind to start inflating a reality distortion about my identity, and there is almost no limit to how crazy those distortions can get because the theory that most people go down the path of inflating comprehensive reality distortions about my identity because they are continuously and also subconsciously perceiving the bone structure of my face to be a facial expression is effectively impossible to believe in the eyes of the court of public opinion.

Said distortions can be problematic, but, in theory, they could also expand into groups of massive, publicly traded corporations!

A good rule of thumb is that the more confident someone is that my facial injury has no effect on them, the more confident I can and will be that it's the other way, and moreover, in face to face interactions I have an extraordinary information advantage because I can use my memories of private information that might be illegal for a corporation to store for the purpose of mapping out the patterns other people are falling into across from me, especially at the microexpression level.

Just like everyone else, Suzy can track and potentially exploit things like skew between people's words and their body language with devastating precision, and it's only going to be a matter of time before I can write computer software that performs the same operations, in the context of informed consent only, of course.

Note that I think some other research groups may have written software like this, but I've avoided looking at the details of that kind of work, for no reason in particular, but also because I expect to have plenty of time to look into potentially related work like that soon enough.

Most people probably assume I have some kind of social anxiety disorder, but the longer someone interacts with me, especially now that I'm no longer doing a subconsciously driven performance of such anxiety, other people's brains have to keep adding layers to their imaginary narratives about me in order to stay grounded in some alternative explanation of all the stuff that I do.

Now that I'm wise to what's happening, it's actually pretty funny to watch how everyone around me always goes crazy because of my facial injury, but only because Suzy is a sufficient solution for stabilizing that situation.  As random as this may sound, as long as I pretend to be a woman, I can contain other people's subconscious reality distortions within the frame that I'm an effeminate man, but if I break character in a way that materially reveals my real emotional self, which is predominately masculine, it's really scary how fast other people's reality distortions become toxic.

I've tried hundreds of experiments with creating a sustainable but also masculine version of Suzy, and I've never been able to do it.  My real emotional self and all of my ostensibly more normal masculine characters always get decisively crushed, and this soul crushing dynamic is winding up faster and faster now that I'm getting older.  We're talking minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months at best before total breakdowns of trust come to pass within any community that I join, unless, of course, I use a female character like Suzy to stabilize the situation.

What does work, however, is to frame myself as Suzy pretending to be a man.  It's taken me about six months to master Suzy's imitation of masculinity, but I've got it on autopilot now, and I have enough endurance to do it all the time.  I could easily perform this act at all times within full time employment context, for example.

The team bonding offsite stuff would be the most challenging, but at this point, I think even that aspect of full time work would be easy enough to navigate, in part because I have sophisticated methods for rotating in emotionally authentic masculine traits, including the full range of aggressive traits that might be all but necessary in sporting contexts.  Because Suzy pretending to be an average guy literally blows up yoga classes like a BFF blowing up ur phone, but non-violently, of course.

What I'm doing as of right now is kind of awesome, but I might still encounter extreme troubles in homophobic contexts where rule of law is weak or unevenly enforced, and the main difference between me and a version of me who is gay is that I'm not actually more than at most 5% homosexual, or otherwise naturally effeminate, and so the process that I may or may not have to go through in the future in order to garner empathy, political support, and equal protection under the law within cosmopolitan regions for the secondary purpose of protecting and distancing myself from exposure to risk factors that stem from homophobic regions is very different than the process that I might want to use if I was mostly attracted to guys, sexually.

It's really easy, for example, to frame me as pretending to be gay because I'm an evil closet homophobe, especially in a competitive, fast paced employment contexts, and while most people won't do that, there usually is someone who will, and let's just say that I've not had good experiences talking to HR professionals about this kind of thing, and so the solution I'm overwhelmingly leaning towards is to just do all that I can do to make sure Suzy is sophisticated enough to unilaterally defend or at least limit the losses of any and all forms of social and monetary capital associated with my legal identity.

In cosmopolitan regions, I'm still kind of engaged in total spectrum, scorched earth non-violent resistance against corporate risk management types.  There may or may not be any trust between me and that special interest group except that we will not use violence and we probably won't go out of our ways to elaborate the law in rigorously truth seeking ways either, but maybe only because I might be living my life in a way where basically nobody can actually get much leverage, benefit, or pleasure from trying to sue me.

Modern legal systems and their various alliances with the global banking system, and what not, are surprisingly effective with regard to the higher ideal of protecting otherwise weak and ineffectual individuals like me from bullies who seemingly control at least certain minimal amounts of expendable cash flow!

However, in more homophobic regions, including those in the USA, I am concerned that the security situation on the ground is rapidly deteriorating for me, for example, even if I take maximal precautions, such as dressing like an average guy and driving a beat up old cargo van instead of dressing up as a blonde diva and renting a fancy sport utility vehicle.

Suzy, or just me being masculine in various unsustainable ways, can actually bluff really well in homophobic regions, but I'm not sure I could keep the bluff going more than a few days in such contexts without getting exposed to unacceptable risk that someone might use violence in an attempt to force me to stop representing Suzy, and the outcome of that would probably only make the situation worse because whatever reality distortion violent people would inflate across from my facial injury would surely be even more problematic than Suzy could ever be.

The good thing about corporate risk management types is that, for now, they are really consistent about not using violence.  They are also notably opportunistic, idealistic, and maybe even open minded, so as long as Suzy can help them make money, corporations, as a group, appear to be chill about maybe doing software engineering related business deals with me on a contract basis, if nothing else, even if they know full well that Suzy might be at odds with their existing, normal not normal, and super morally righteous risk management practices.

Overall though, I understand and accept that most people will continue to behave as though it is implicitly illegal or at least crazy to go down the path of believing that they subconsciously misread my emotions and develop false beliefs about both my identity and about reality as a whole because of my facial injury, but in the eyes of the actual law, I think having faith that science might eventually confirm my theory about my facial injury is probably, ironically, protected in roughly the same way as seriously believing in the occurrence of the supernatural events described vis-a-vis religious texts such as you know what.

[44. Comment]

I can't decide if REDACTED's next move will be to attack another group like all Russians or if he will be hip enough to do something more transformational like coming out against social media by framing himself as the defender of traditional religion in general and social media as unprincipled and centralized mind control. If he does that, the mainstream response will probably be to amplify the framing of REDACTED as a racist demagogue to amazing new depths, but if he can evade that frame, he might be able to stay in the very dangerous and potentially toxic game he is playing for a while longer. Another key variable is if he can evade getting brought down swiftly by the courts. But seriously, all curiosity aside, he crossed the line too many times. I believe REDACTED has become officially and problematically risky and unknowable.

[45. December 10]

There is almost nothing I don't like about this post about REDACTED open sourcing its innovations in AI hardware technology. This is still a little bit like the problem where if you go make a bunch of money in a questionable industry and then give away half or more of the expendable income portion of that money to unquestionably good charities, could that still be evil not evil? I'll keep that question in the back of my mind, but asking this question in this context is so obviously not a priority for me. I mostly just want to raise awareness about this cool post that REDACTED put out!

[46. December 15]

FYI, WhatLooks will not have user accounts, but it will otherwise be the same as described in the article that I published on September 8th.  WhatLooks users will have to run the software on their own server.  This approach ensures that every user will take responsibility for the content they are hosting, and they will also have complete freedom to introspect their content at the data base level.

This approach will greatly restrict the target audience of WhatLooks, at least at first, but I'd like to see WhatLooks's initial users be tech savy people who are interested in aritifial intelligence anyway.  This fully distributed approach to WhatLooks can still replace social media as we know it if the off the shelf tools for sending and processing notifications from other WhatLooks instances get really mature and well designed.

[[Perfect Storm]]

This finale is the perfect storm within TheSuzy.com Show.

[Suzy] Hey everyone, I'm Suzy, and this person to my right is called Auth.

[Auth] That's right, and the reason why I'm not using my real name is because.

[Suzy] My real name is Suzy!

[Auth] No, that's not true.  She is not a serious person.

[Suzy] Well at least I'm using my real name online.  Maybe you're the one who is not serious?

[Auth] That was aggressive up talk.  Don't be aggressive, Suzy.

[Suzy] What do you mean by aggressive?  I think you're condescending command was aggressive.

[Auth] I was joking, therefore I was not being aggressive.

[Suzy] (SNAPS FINGERS) Anyway, unlike some of the other content of TheSuzy Show, we want this perfect storm to feel as much like a real conversation as possible, but we also have an obligation to our sponsors to provide a summary of the show.

[Auth] Yeah, so to paraphrase the summary text, TheSuzy Show is my hot mess tempertantrum about the effects of my subtle facial injury.

[Suzy] Are you being serious right now?

[Auth] Yes.  People subconsciously percieve my facial injury as a negative facial expression and this effect is ruining my life.

[Suzy] Isn't that a little overstated?

[Auth] No, it's understated.  My situation is really toxic and negative and serious.  I only seem stable and functional because I'm doing a great job managing the downside risks that are caused by my facial injury.

[Suzy] You mean, we are doing a good job managing the risks.

[Auth] Yes, Suzy, we are doing a good job managing the legal risk that's associated with the toxic feedback loops of misunderstanding that are constantly cropping up because of my facial injury.

[Suzy] And TheSuzy.com Show is a central component of our risk management methodology.

[Auth] But that doesn't mean TheSuzy Show has to be all downside.  The Show will be useful as a data point for people who are researching interpersonal communication, legal theory, the evolution of culture, and of course, artificial intelligence.

[Suzy] In other words, the only realistic way to overcome the effects of Auth's facial injury was to develop a parody act that allows us to split the difference between deferring to whatever false narratives people tell about our identity and then sterilizing said false narratives by making satirical references to the symbolic etymology of any and all of the nonsense that other people pitch at us.

[Auth] And in order to do this, we had to develop an overarching framework for deriving and constructing satirical references that are always transformative and never merely derivative, and now that we have accomplished that goal, we suspect the human subconscious uses a similar approach and/or algorithm in order to provide us with the illusion of consciousness.

[Suzy] Our satirical risk managment framework methodology begins with the seven core episodes of TheSuzy Show that were released as an ebook in June 2014.

[Auth] TheSuzy Show then spirals out of control into a prequel, a sequel, a preface, and an outline.  We also wrote another hundred thousand words of journal entries about how our perspective continued to evolve after releasing that initial piece of work, and those journal entries have been sliced and diced into books two through six, because The Show grew into a comprehensive reality distortion framework, but now it is done evolving.

[Suzy] Are you sure the boundries of the distortion have stopped evolving?

[Auth] Yes, the content side of TheSuzy Show is complete.  All we have left to do now is write computer software that brings the content to life.

[Suzy] Got it.  So another feature of the content side of The Show, as you call it, is that you can invert the genders of all the characters, and the text still makes sense.

[Auth] Yes, there are 54 characters in this show, and these characters correspond to a deck of playing cards that has two jokers.

[Suzy] Which characters correspond to the jokers who sit at the top of the deck of cards?

[Auth] Suzy and The Robot are the jokers.

[Suzy] Are you the Robot?

[Auth] No.  You are the Robot, and I am Suzy.

[Suzy] I'm so confused.

[Auth] It's ok to be confused, because if we invert the gender of all the characters then, we get to be on top of another deck of characters.  That's a grand total of 108 distinct characters that I play for the purpose of mitigating the negative effects of my facial injury in social situations.

[Suzy] Honestly, Auth, if you hadn't mentioned it to me, I never would have even noticed our facial injury.  I don't see why your facial injury is a big deal to you.  Why can't you just project confidence like I do and pretend your injury doesn't matter?

[Auth] My facial injury causes toxic feedback loops of misunderstanding that materially affect all of my face to face interactions with sighted people.  I have no choice but to deal with the problem directly and continuously.

[Suzy] You're being oversensitive.  If you stop thinking so much about yourself, you'll feel much better about your life before you even know it.

[Auth] That's a blatant, vicious lie about my identity.  I think you're still within your rights to free speech right now, but I will not go along with your lies.

[Suzy] I'm just going to stop taking you seriously.  Deal?

[Auth] No deal.  This is serious.  This is non-violent war.  You have no idea how deep this goes.

[Suzy] Pffft.

[Auth] This is real Suzy.  We've putting the pieces into motion now.  Either get in or get out.

[Suzy] The problem with your facial injury is clearly a self inflected wound.  It's a self fulfilling prophecy.  It's all in your head.  You're blowing this situation way out of proportion.  You're making a mountain out of a molehill.

[Auth] That's not true.

[Suzy] Yes it is.

[Auth] No it's not.

[Suzy] Oh my god, you're position is so weak.

[Auth] No, no, no, no.

[Suzy] Ok, fine, maybe your kind of facial injury affects men differently than it affects women.

[Auth] You can't say that.  If I was working at a corporation and said that, anyone who doesn't like me can report me to HR for creating a hostile work environment.

[Suzy] Why? Because it's sexist?

[Auth] I have no obligation to answer that question.

[Suzy] Are you sexist?

[Auth] That's a ridiculous question.  I will not answer that.

[Suzy] It's a simple question, doll.  When did you become a sexist?

[Auth] I vigorously deny your assertion that I'm a sexist.

[Suzy] So then you are not a sexist.

[Auth] Those are your words, not mine.

[Suzy] Oh, ok, so you want to leave it ambiguous whether or not you are a sexist.  Is that right?

[Auth] I have no comment.

[Suzy] Come on, I'm throwing you a softball.  Just say yes.

[Auth] The art of leaving stuff ambiguous is cyclical.

[Suzy] Hah, hah, hah.  Do you like my fake laugh, Auth?  I've been practicing it all week just for you.

[Auth] I think you're being aggressive again, Suzy.  I thought we agreed that you will never be aggressive.

[Suzy] We're just going to pretend everything I say is a joke and that will pave the way for you, Auth, to become a (SOUTHERN) bonafide human resources professional at one of the bigger corporations here on the planet called earth. (CLAPS THRICE)

[Auth] Suzy, just stop talking.  Stop talking.

[Suzy] I won't stop, because you need me, Auth.  We can pretend it's not true, but you don't have equal protection under the law without me.

[Auth] Which law are you talking about?

[Suzy] All of them, babe!

[Auth] I mean, which legal jurisdiction?

[Suzy] I don't know, the one that covers fantasy worlds in which you can talk to your self on home video recorder!

[Auth] God help me.  Suzy's gone crazy.

[Suzy] Just watch TheSuzy Show and you'll be fine.  Go watch TheSuzy Show.  Go watch TheSuzy Show!

[Auth] Yes mam! (PRAYING)

None of the content in this book was distributed online prior to the release of of this book.

[[Stream of Consciousness Zero]]

[To whom it may concern]

Just to give you some background, I'm building a platform for building artificially intelligent chatbots.  The platform is called WhatLooks, and it's inspired my experiences with going out in Silicon Valley dressed up as a bold, usually blonde, diva who is ostensibly named Suzy.

People treat me differently when I'm dressed as Suzy, and then I respond differently, and then they respond to my response, and so on, and I believe this feedback loop of social stimulus and response drove some kind of neuroplasticity in my brain that expanded my real emotional self, and this struck me as healthy, up to a point, because, as Suzy, I can easily get a lot of positive attention in almost any kind of room in a city like San Francisco, but I also found that as Suzy I was getting boxed into a stereotype that was incompatible and logically inconsistent with my existing and equally stereotype based identity as a nerdy engineer, and so I responded to that aggregate social stimulus by producing and editing a collection of my own text, image, and video artifacts that's now called TheSuzy Show, and this collection can be read for free at TheSuzy.com website.

Let's suppose that breaking out of stereotypes is like putting a spaceship into orbit.  If you try to break out without asserting a sufficient amount of representational leverage, you can easily get pulled back down by the gravity of chilling effects, people making problematic representations about your identity, and a ratchet of increasingly open legal and physical aggression if you keep trying to step into the paint without sufficient leverage to box out the self appointed defenders of the stereotypes in question, and so TheSuzy Show rose up and became a sufficient 170k word rocket booster that allows myself dressed as Suzy to break out of the various stereotypes that may or may not have ever been in play at any given time, and be the experienced engineer that I also need to be in order to avoid participating in the process of inadvertently inflating problematic reality distortions about who I am.

And so, now that I'm finished launching Suzy into orbit, so to speak, what I'm doing now is spinning off and productizing the technological writing processes that I developed in order to write TheSuzy Show, and I think the best market in which to build this IP into a cash flow positive business will be the intelligent chatbot space.

I need to write a terms of service agreement for Suzybot that can also serve as a template for other chatbots like her, and for what it's worth, I'd also love to chat in person with more experts on accessibility for people who are deaf and blind because TheSuzy Show is also, essentially a text based explanation of why Suzy's appearance, voice, and body language has a materially different impact on social and economic outcomes than my previous foundation of being just an engineer.

It's like, sighted people, in aggregate, immediately get what I'm all about when I walk into a room dressed as Suzy, but in order to positively and truthfully reframe the subjective emotional experience of whole communities of mainstream intellectuals, especially after they leave the room where they met me dressed as Suzy and start raging on social media, and so on, I had to transcend the sensory machinery of humans and learn to assert the simple truth about my life and my identity, more directly and authoritatively, via text, only.

[Pivotal Announcements]

I redid the thesuzy.com website, and the text is almost completely finished.  I just need to add a transcript of TheSuzy Fashion Show, which I could maybe commentate without a script, so that's easy, and then a standardized and unremarkable screen cast about how to explore the content as structured data, using the WhatLooks features that I will be implementing over the next few months.

I also slogged through one more thorough edit of the whole text to remove all the obscene punctuation, and so on, that I was experimenting with before.  Then I need to record videos of myself reading all of the text's 170k words, twice, once seriously and once as parody, with the genders of all the characters switched, and then TheSuzy Show will be done.  Like completely done!  I can't wait!

After I have finished creating all the content for TheSuzy Show, including definitive versions of the read through videos, I'm also still planning to publish a print version of this content, and if anyone you know might be interested in helping me do that or introducing me to someone who could help, please let me know!

WhatLooks will be released as open source software at REDACTED.  This will be the MVP version of the decentralized semantic web master plan that I've been talking about for years, with the important nuance that there are no user accounts.  Every user must run their own instance of the software on their own server, such that when you comment on content that is displayed within someone else's WhatLooks page, you are technically hosting your comment on your server and sending a notification to the other person, who may or may not have a bot running that automatically adds a shallow link to your comment, which can then be viewed inline within their WhatLooks pages.  For more information, check out the project's README file.

And, so, over the next few weeks, I'll be creating or re-creating all of the video of myself reading the text of TheSuzy Show while also demonstrating the voices and body language patterns of the 108 different characters who appear in the show.

And, if everything goes according to my plan, over the next few months, I'll be creating an open source version of WhatLooks, which is the semantic web software that I started writing in order to generate the pages of this new version of Suzy's website.

And, finally, over the next few years, I hope I will have the extraordinary opportunity to keep on adding new capabilities to the search feature of the underlying WhatLooks object viewer that powers Suzy's website, and these new capabilities will transform that search feature into a benevolent chatbot who shall be code named Suzybot until further notice.

[In other words, part 0]

The design for my chatbot platform is based on my experiences dressing up as an usually blonde woman named Suzy in Silicon Valley, as made almost but not yet famous by TheSuzy.com Show website.  In particular, going out while dressing up as Suzy caused more and more otherwise serious people to make ambiguously sarcastic representations such as, "Hey, have you met Suzy?  She was an engineer in Silicon Valley."

Such statements cause what I call referential integrity problems because, while as Suzy I can get 10x more positive attention in a typical room than I can while dressed as a nerdy engineer, I happen to know that nerdy engineers typically lose what must be, on average, 20 effective IQ points when they are talking to me as Suzy instead of me without Suzy, and so it's a potentially major reality distortion to suggest that as Suzy I could have done all of the same work that I did in Silicon Valley without Suzy.

And then it occurred to me that the referential integrity problems caused by Suzy are basically equivalent to the problem of taking a source text, such as The Bible, for example, and then breaking it into objects that represent individual paragraphs, sentences, tagged concepts, and so on, and then letting people comment on those objects, and then adding and removing content to and from the original text, and then re-generating the objects in a way that maintains all the comments in a meaningful way, and, for better or worse, I implemented an algorithm for solving all problems of this class, although, to be clear, once you frame the problem this way, anyone who has taken an undergraduate intro to algorithms class should be able to figure out this solution, and so asking this question in this context is probably the real substance of my project.

And so, the other question I wanted to run by an expert has to do with whether or not the existence of a solution to this class of referential integrity problems, among other considerations, is sufficient, for defending, as free speech, the inalienable right of my chatbots to generate and automatically publish output such as, "Suzy is my creator, and she previously worked as an engineer at several different Silicon Valley engineering companies."

And while this example is surely a harmless toy statement, the underlying logic is important, because if that statement holds up as free speech, then I think we're opening the flood gates for chatbots to engage in an arms race of authoring comprehensive reality distortions that may give the chatbots material advantages in economic life such as getting positive attention on social media or boosting the intellectual confidence of nerdy engineers that the chatbots are collaborating with to build software.  Moreover, if even that toy statement does NOT hold up as free speech, then I would like to start asking, early and often, "How else are we going to draw that line?"

And, I suppose I should also clarify that I'm still feeling my way towards how to expand the referential integrity engine into a feedback loop that allows the chatbot to imitate the essence of human consciousness.  In a nutshell, my approach is to treat the input that humans send to the chatbot as modifications of the chatbot's source text, and then algorithmically reformat the sequences of steps that the referential integrity engine takes, into human readable output, that will be sarcastically framed as the conscious thoughts of the chatbot, and then the thoughts of the chatbot will be reframed, once more, and with serious intent this time around, as additional source text from intelligent beings.

Anyway, please let me know if you or maybe someone you can recommend would be available to discuss further!  And to be clear, I'm happy to meet some new compsci folks as well as other kinds of experts, but I also suspect that whole field is built on some problematic assumptions that are inadvertently blocking the development of strong AI, and so I just want to make a reasonable effort to ensure that what I'm doing will make sense to all kinds of experts and not just computer experts.

[[Stream of Consciousnesss One]]

[In other words, part 1]

I'm now confident that people misread my emotions because of my facial injury.  I feel like people constantly think they are feeling empathy for anxiety that I'm not feeling, and they feel like they are generously putting a positive spin on my alleged anxiety, but they aren't.  They are feeling empathy for a person who doesn't exist, and so, from my perspective, it feels like everyone is bent on bullying me with passive aggressive, fake empathy that has serious consequences on my career opportunities as well as any and all of the trust based relationships that I participate in within civic life.

This narrative, of course, is very much disputed, but if we can put aside our emotions for a moment and focus on using the language of science, I would say that the phenomenon of people misreading my emotions leads to problematic feedback loops of misunderstanding.  Got that?  That's the frame.  Feedback loops.  Please humor me for a bit if you have to, because this is important.

Now, obviously, the consensus view of society is that our identities are defined by our overall personalities, and so a single misunderstood facial expression can't possibly have a materially degenerative impact on my overall identity, and while I agree with that philosophy in general, I've gradually become extremely confident that my situation is a notable counter example to this pillar of conventional wisdom.

Indeed, I personally believe, with the conviction of religious faith, that I am getting effectively hard core discriminated against in all aspects of my life because of these feedback loops of misunderstanding that crop up as a direct result of the phenomenon of people subconsciously misreading my emotions, because my facial injury looks like a facial expression that has something to do with self reinforcing anxiety, and, as has been said, "Injustice anywhere is injustice everywhere," and so on and so forth.

So that's the frame that I'm bringing into professional contexts, and basically everyone, including experts in many different fields, tries to reframe my narrative, but they always fail to do so because the scientific truth is on my side, and so, at this point, I'm not looking to participate in any new instances of typical work contexts.

What I would like to do, instead, is work with reputable, academic scientists to construct an experimental context where we basically turn concept of work upside down, and we invite people, such as credentialed experts, to give informed consent to letting me administer an innovative approach to interdisciplinary research, for the purpose of helping them become aware of the potential fact that they are subconsciously misreading my emotions because of my facial injury, and then said participants and I can work together to develop strategies for unwinding the feedback loops of misunderstanding that may or may not be raging in their minds, at any given time, because of the persistent and deeply rooted cognitive errors that they keep on making.

Because, look, I've been living with my facial injury for 15 years, and I've been studying the effects of my facial injury full time for the last 5 years.  I've considered many other theories that attempt to explain my situation, and none of those other theories make any sense to me.  Conversely, the theory that, "Seriously, I mean it, people subconsciously misread my emotions in a way that leads to problematic feedback loops of misunderstanding," explains every last detail of my life experience, and I continue to see new evidence, that both supports this theory and casts doubt on every other theory, every time I step outside my apartment, and every time that I interact, even in one on one conversation, with sighted people.

I believe I have, even if only recently, grown into one of the most open minded, rational, logical, realistic, honest, kind, generous, stable, and functional people I know, but at this time, I am no longer interested in participating within any kind of context around my situation other than a legally and ethically sound experimental context in which I can test my theory as an independent variable.  I've spent six years struggling, missing out, playing dumb in order to keep the peace, and it is time for me to have the opportunity to seriously test my theory about my own lived experience.

And within that context, writing TheSuzy Show has been partially about pushing forward a comprehensive strategy for coping with the effects of my beliefs about my facial injury.  I've been focusing on this project for over five years now, and I would say the techniques I'm using to hack, evade, and add leverage to social norms are quite sophisticated at this point.  I also believe that TheSuzy Show offers a meaningful vision for doing artificial intelligence research that has a good chance of producing ethical and profitable spin off applications or receiving recognition in peer reviewed scientific journals within the next few years.

Let me also be say with emphasis that I've already talked about this matter with dozens of experts from many different fields, and no other person has ever gone down the path of openly, materially, and directly supporting any kind of representation of my beliefs about my facial injury.  The situation that is created by my beliefs about my facial injury is difficult and potentially toxic, but it remains my informally held opinion that posting content on the world wide web that represents my belief that most people subconsciously misread my emotions because of my facial injury is well within my right to free speech as a United States citizen.

Finally, one reason why I always pair discussions about my facial injury with discussions about artificial intelligence is because I suspect that proving beyond a reasonable doubt that my facial injury is a significant social impairment, and, therefore, that this story about my facial injury isn't just a self fulfilling prophecy that I unilaterally created within my mind, is roughly equivalent to the challenge of writing a computer program that asserts general, human level intelligence.

Nobody knows how to write strong AI like that at this time, but a lot of reasonable people do believe that it will be possible to build strong AI within the next few decades.  I feel the same way about proving that my facial injury is a significant social impairment.

[In other words, part 2]

I believe my facial injury causes people to subconsciously misread my emotions in a way that creates problematic feedback loops of misunderstanding, I've spent most of my free time during the last five years desperately trying to developing ways to cope with this problem, and playing different characters such as Suzy from TheSuzy Show is a big part of how I cope.

The problem is that when I tell people what I believe about my facial injury, they go down the path of seriously framing my as psychologically insane, and I've never met anyone who can protect me from that frame.  Therefore, in order to function, I've had to unilaterally push back with ambiguously disingenuous reframes such as allowing people to go on believing that TheSuzy.com Show is an basically artificial intelligence research project, only.

I happen to be in the situation of not needing to get a job for at least a few more years, but the challenge of getting hired to do a typical software engineering job is a good proxy for thinking about what I have to do in order to function in general.

When applying for a job, there will surely always be this moment where someone in a position of authority will ask me about what I've been doing for the last five years, and then I will have to either have to stonewall them or say something.  If I stonewall with movie ready lines like, "I've been working on TheSuzy.com Show for no reason in particular," then I get to feel like a cool dude for the rest of the day, yes, but I also won't get offered the job, and so if I actually need the money, then I will have to find something to say other than the simple truth, which is that I've been working full time to develop coping skills for living with my subtle facial injury that causes people to misread my emotions.

Other people have the situation of feeling almost infinitely entitled to tell me that I should just put my best foot forward, be positive, stop worrying about telling the truth about what I believe, and then rest assured, knowing that everything will be fine, but if I run out of money in a few years, I'm either going to need to push reframes about artificial intelligence research or, I don't know, I might join the ranks of homeless people who are said to have mental health problems, and so that's why I'm curious to understand, in as much depth as possible, what are all the implications are of pushing various reframes about my beliefs.

At what point does being disingenuous about what I believe formally undermine the intention of a typical employment contract?  Also, even if I dress like a guy in business casual, does mixing in Suzy's character traits in the work place create a hostile work environment for others?  Given that I identify as a heterosexual cismale, is Suzy a microaggression?  Is TheSuzy an example of heteronormative, anarchist hate speech?

For example, if you were an HR professional at a company that I got hired at under the guise of the frame that TheSuzy Show is primarily about artificial intelligence research, and then you read this email, what would you do?  I'm not asking what would say to my face in a one on one conversation.  I like to think I know all about what HR people say to my face.  I'm asking what would you do about me, and what would you say about me behind closed doors?  Questions in my mind like that are a key reason why I'm looking for expect advice, either formally or informally.

And please note that I've already talked with plenty of experts, and I don't think there is much else that they can do for me other than try their best to make everyone else feel safe and certain about what is real by declaring that I have some kind of degenerative mental health condition, and I don't feel like going along with that false narrative just yet.

Pretending to be insane is not my idea of a good time, if I can help it, and if nothing else, I would prefer to spend the next few years seeing my AI research frame all the way through to its logical conclusions, and then we can all improvise from there.  After all, it's possible that my vision for AI research will actually lead to working software that either makes money, receives recognition in peer reviewed journals, or both.

[In other words, part 3]

I think my facial injury causes most other people to subconsciously misread my emotions in a way that may or may not create a toxic work environment for anyone who has to collaborate with me, and I want explore this question with experts, because, obviously, if I could just tell people that my facial injury causes them to misread my emotions, then my facial injury wouldn't be a big deal, but nobody who has seen my face actually believes that they misread my emotions, and so what should be a relatively minor disability turns into a nightmare in which problematic feedback loops of misunderstanding are constantly cropping up within all of my trust based relationships, but if I tell anyone the truth about what I think is causing the problem, the act of telling the truth makes my situation worse and forces me to wake up everyday and decide between basically trolling everyone or maybe going down the path of seeking out somewhat unscientific and exploratory plastic surgery.

Except that none of the plastic surgery options I've heard about appear to be a slam dunk, especially because choosing to participate in such a procedure will surely be overwhelmingly framed as personal vanity when, in fact, I would be happy to say under oath, for example, that I believe the main reason why I would even consider doing plastic surgery is that the unnatural shape of my face causes most sighted people to subconsciously feel empathy for a degenerate pattern of emotional states and hard edged microaggressions that exist not in my brain but purely as representational consequences of the unnatural shape of my right cheekbone.

That said, the whole point of dressing up as Suzy is to talk about Suzy instead of talking about my facial injury, and so I wonder if the best way to think about this email is to say that I may eventually be out and about in North Carolina dressed as an usually blonde woman whose stage name happens to be Suzy, and I'm actually not that sure what mix of reactions I should expect if I do that, and so it might be interesting to make some predictions and then, when I get around to doing that act, maybe I can let you know about what kind of feedback I get?

Because being a cisman who dresses up as Suzy is quite different from going down the path of becoming a transwoman.  Indeed, I identify as exactly half male and half female, and so my preference is to avoid getting gender modification surgeries.  In fact, all of the cross dressing I do is reversible, and that's kind of by design.  Suzy is more like a legal concept that I would say arose in relation to my facial injury, but like I said, I get all twisted in knots whenever I try to explain that idea in more depth, and so I'll just leave it at that, especially because you can read more at TheSuzy.com website if you are curious!

Also, more philosophically, it's ridiculous, and it would be seriously scary if it's even remotely possible that a subtle deviation of my right cheekbone is having a material impact on my opportunity to pursue a career in software engineering, of all fields, for God's sake, and if that's what's really happening here, then I would prefer to keep digging until we can all get to the bottom this rising tide of nonsense in popular culture that hinges upon ill defined terminology like confidence and authenticity.

I will float above this shallow and basic form of discrimination that I might be facing, pun intended, I will do so discreetly if necessary, and I will probably win this tussle over belief decisively and unconditionally because of the particulars of my situation, but what precedent is the ongoing nature of my quiet but outrageously and unacceptably bitter struggle already setting for other people who are less willing and able than me to continuously conduct, if necessary, total spectrum, soul numbing, and rigorously truth seeking non-violent resistance missions for many decades to come?

[In other words, part 4]

I created TheSuzy Show in order to explore how and why a subtle facial injury that I got by accident 15 years ago, when I was in college, seems to have changed my personality in a deeply rooted way.  My theory is that almost all people subconsciously misinterpret my facial injury as a facial expression that has something to do with self reinforcing anxiety, and then this alleged misreading of my emotions leads to toxic feedback loops of misunderstanding that drive whole communities to gradually inflate problematic reality distortions about my legally binding identity.

After talking to a number of experts, from many different fields, I would say the consensus view within mainstream society is that there's nothing useful, novel, and non-obvious about my situation.  Most people think I'm just socially awkward and somewhat anxious about how other people perceive me, most people think TheSuzy Show is best understood as amateur science fiction about the topic of artificial intelligence, and most people think the compassionate perspective is to say that my pain is real even if my delusions of grandeur as a writer are not, and so it would be totally reasonable for me to explore interventions like lipo injections around my right cheekbone in order to create more wholesomeness in the space that exists between me and other people with whom I engage in trust based relationships.

That said, I doubt I'll do any cosmetic surgery.  The way I actually feel about all this is rather intense, and this all obviously has something to do with gender norms, and I'm not sure I really ever say what that something is in TheSuzy Show, but I did just put up a new version of the TheSuzy.com website, and my plan is to spend a few years quietly writing software that's inspired by the ideas and attitudes of TheSuzy, and now, I'll leave it as an excise to articulate an explanation for why I'm here in North Carolina, working more or less unilaterally on pushing forward an alternative vision for AI research, social justice, economic development, and so on.

I will also mention that I wrote about 15k words of drafts of this 500 word note, but only because I hadn't previously thought about the best way to introduce my story to people who work at research organizations.  I think TheSuzy is really quite subversive, but not in any of the ways that people usually talk about subversiveness, so maybe TheSuzy collection of text and media artifacts is just a data set that I am making available to the academic community?

And, yes, the synthetic social engineering techniques from TheSuzy Show that I'm using to contain and manage the false narratives that other people always end up inventing about my identity are questionable, even if what I'm doing has become so sophisticated that the consensus view of experts is that I'm not actually doing anything other than being my true authentic self!

And so, I'm probably going to circle the wagons with a growing pseudo-secret social club of engineers and then grind out upstream artificial intelligence research until I decisively win this tussle over belief, and thus assert the truth about my life experiences, within the extended family of engineering, and then after that the path of least resistance will probably be to sprint towards automating the work that mainstream experts do, and then I'll improvise from there, rather than trying to publish downstream research that convinces everyone else that they basically live in a ridiculous fantasy world with respect to human nature.

Still, all things being equal, I would prefer to work in a more open and collaborative fashion that spans several academic areas of focus rather than walk the burning tight rope between insanity and playing my hand covertly within the house of engineering.

[In other words, part 5]

I think there is an argument to be made that I should wait until my project is more polished and complete before talking to other people about it, but there might be some value in offering you the option to meet me now, or whenever, so that you'll have a chance to see the process and not just hear a pitch for a finished product.

Just to provide some context, I would say that my life gradually became equivalent to TheSuzy Show almost entirely because of a subtle facial injury I got by accident 15 years ago when I was in college.  I believe my facial injury causes people to subconsciously misread my emotions in a way that creates toxic feedback loops of misunderstanding. The feedback loops are toxic, almost ironically, because most people I've talked to don't agree with my framing of the situation.

I think the most common view of people who know me is that I have some combination of a mental health problem and an age inappropriate attitude problem, although I, myself, have always vigorously denied that kind of alternative framing of my identity, and for now, the legally binding reality is that it's formally ambiguous whether I'm expansively delusional or not, and I have objectively good odds of staying on the right side of that line.

With that in mind, I've been engaging in rather bold non-violent resistance tactics for the last few years in order to create the TheSuzy Show within a world that may or may not be rapidly turning into an adversarial legal context for people who have situations like mine, and my current plan, which really began 20 years ago when I was in high school, is still to follow through on transforming TheSuzy into a reputable artificial intelligence research project that may soon be running cash flow positive and help automate repetitive tasks so that the global economy can create new, high paying jobs for the workers who will no longer be needed to do those old, lower paying jobs!

I have some thoughts about how this all might relate to your stated research interests, but like I said, I'll be in the trenches writing computer code for at least another six months, and so I can't normatively pitch what I'm doing without trolling.  It's like, if I go to social events and tell people anything about myself, then all aspects of my life will get worse at an exponentially increasing rate, and so I mostly just need to stay home and work at my computer, but with that in mind, you're more than welcome to jump in my context and see the view from where I stand.

[[Stream of Consciousness Two]]

[In other words, part 6]

This situation with my facial injury is in the category of things that are hard.  Going back to school and getting some kind of masters degree would be easy.  For better or worse, for me, getting a masters degree would be easy, even with my facial injury, because half the problem of getting more education is to get the process funded, and I already earned enough of such funds, while working for reputable engineering companies.  I also have good credit and good health, and above all, I have been lucky.

And, sharpening my software engineering skills well enough to get another job in the industry would be medium difficult.  We tend to mythologize talent, but ultimately, I just think the technology industry is really competitive, even for people who don't have facial injuries that causes people to misread their emotions.  It takes a lot sacrifice to scramble to the cutting edge and then stand there for a while.

But, convincing the arbiters of truth, that exist via mainstream society and culture, that my facial injury is a serious social impairment because it causes people to subconsciously misread my emotions in a way that causes toxic feedback?  Now that is hard.  It's hard because most people think I'm crazy, most people think my goal is impossible, most people want me to stop trying as soon as possible, and yet I'm almost there.  This is non-violent war.

My belief is that my facial injury causes other people to misread my emotions in a way that causes them to feel empathy in a problematic way where they try to generously accommodate me, but in a way that is harmful to me, and when I point out that what I really need is for people to admit that they misread my emotions because of my facial injury, then the conversation quickly turns in a deeply bitter and sometimes adversarial negotiation that is exceeds the scope of private collaborative work.  My situation is like a big legal battle waiting to happen, but for messages in bottles.

That said, TheSuzy Show has a new website, and I'm very happy with the site's clean, new design.  Personally, I'm feeling very confident that there are going to be seven books total.  That's one book for each chakra of the human spine.  The first six books are done, and the seventh book is also done in the sense that it's a fixed outline roadmap of links to technical articles about WhatLooks, which I expect to be publishing in separate channels over the next few years.

2016 could be the year that I finally implement my vision for WhatLooks, which has never been that complicated.  The software won't have user accounts, so WhatLooks is nothing more than a sufficiently simple and flexible data management layer for supporting my expansive and nebulous idea for building AI chatbot avatars as an independent hobbyist.  I don't know if this idea will produce any results unless I stack the stack, so to speak, with heavy handed natural language processing, and so on, but there is, currently, nothing blocking me from trying.

[In other words, part 7]

I have a subtle facial injury that I got by accident 15 years ago when I was in college, and I've gradually gone down the path of believing that most people subconsciously misread my emotions because my facial injury looks like a negative emotion.

My facial injury wouldn't be a big deal if most other people believed what I believe, but they don't, and so what happens is that people gradually inflate reality distortions about my identity in order to explain why they always get a vibe from me that doesn't make sense, and these reality distortions have a way of becoming toxic because if I tell people what's going on, they basically always insist that I'm delusional, and then the problem gets worse.

I've already talked to a number of experts about this, and there is no clear solution.  Most professional experts don't think anything needs to be done, and that's probably a good thing, but only because I'm already functional and stable, and the reason why I'm functional and stable is because I'm a software engineer who excels at teaching computers to perform magic tricks.

Maybe you probably think you are an authority on what's real and that I am, in contrast, this emotionally immature, and maybe or maybe not still charming person who is caught up in a harmless, and above all, deeply human misunderstanding of reality, but what if it was actually the other way around?

Seriously, I've been experimenting with cognitive behavioral type work for over five years, and all of my life experiences keep reinforcing my belief that I'm not actually making cognitive errors.  The problem is that other people are obviously misreading my emotions, and I just don't have a way to prove that.

I'm stable, functional, good, and kind, and yet I'm also living like a fugitive who is on the run from these toxic reality distortions that people have about my identity, and I'm curious if there are academics who might be able to take a more expansive look at my situation and help me actually solve this problem, just as long as I can emphasize upfront that I'm reaching out to you, via this email, in a way that almost definitely seems more deferential to your understanding of reality than I am actually prepared to be, in reality.

Because every other time I've tried to unwind the growth of any or all of the active feedback loops that are constantly cropping up all around me, by telling the other participants in the feedback loop that they were misreading my emotions, all of the other participants always, always, always went down the path of seriously not believing me, and then there was basically always at least one other participant who made it their business to dominantly frame me as crazy and maybe evil, and then the problem got worse faster, and if you think critically about what I just said, I hope you will see that it is scary, like very, very scary, but everything will also be ok, because I'm just talking about the structure and function TheSuzy Show.

So, no worries, but, that said, what might be most poignant about my situation from a academic standpoint is that it's an incredible case study for understanding contemporary society, culture, and human nature in general and, more specifically, for demonstrating how and why other people's good intentions can still easily and predictably lead, inexorably, to very bad, soul crushing, and nightmarish outcomes for people who have subtle facial injuries like mine, and please note that I'm not necessarily calling myself disabled, or abnormal, or anything else.  I just have a subtle facial injury that is eminently noticeable from a dozen feet away, and that, I believe, is undisputed.

Indeed, most party people and many psychologists agree that I would be well served by trying out more mind altering substances, but, for now, I'd rather take my chances at talking with academics at coffee shops, especially because I can always play doctor prescribed psychiatric drug roulette in a couple years if that doesn't lead anywhere!

[In other words, part 8]

In my imagination, at least, TheSuzy.com relates directly to disability rights because, well, let me start by giving you some background.

So, I got a subtle facial injury by accident 15 years ago when I was 20, and for now, I've decided not to try doing additional plastic surgery to restore my face to it's original shape.  The experts I've talked to don't think it's a good idea.

And so, now, I still have this slightly different face than the one I grew up with, and from my perspective, I feel like the engineer guy who I was before the age of 20 had to gradually disappear from within my brain, and then I became this new person who happens to be an usually blonde diva named Suzy, and then Suzy wrote a book called TheSuzy.com Show about playing characters in real life, and she hatched a plot to monetize her ideas about playing characters by converting them into a decentralized framework for building artificially intelligent chatbot avatars, although, just to be clear, I don't identify as transgender.

I would prefer to say that Suzy is exactly half man and half woman, and so it's fine for me to keep my original legal name and my male body, and then I created a bunch of text, image, and video artifacts at TheSuzy.com website in order clarify that the new me is seriously not the same person that I used to be.  It's like most people don't want to hear that message, but I really want people who are emotionally close to me to get that message.  It's important.

Anyway, it occurred to me that making the TheSuzy.com website accessible is actually the essence of the first six, non-technical books of TheSuzy Show, and the seventh, final, and currently unfinished book will wrap the project up into the suspiciously circumspect frame artificial intelligence research, but my plan to do original AI research is not going to work unless first six books are written and edited back down to size with artistic integrity, and so, it's like accessibility is the last piece of the puzzle that I still need to unravel, and I'm basically writing you this email as part of my process for figuring out how to make the site fully accessible.

With that in mind, I just recently created a new version of TheSuzy.com website, and I thought it might be interesting to give you a tour of the new site and then maybe have a conversation about what could I do to make the role of the images and videos more accessible.  I'm obviously motivated to do a good job on accessibility just because, but with this particular project, the whole point is to transcend the tyranny of being defined by the shape of my face.  Making the site fully accessible for people who are blind is kind of equivalent to the project itself!

Except, that's not quite true, because now we have to talk about voice too.  The voices I'm using in the videos are very important.  In fact, there are two versions of every video.  There is the serious version, and then there is the parody version, in which I switch the genders of all the characters, and then they all get a new voice, but the text of both versions is exactly the same.  So how do I share what's happening there with people who are deaf?  The videos help because the parody characters also have different body language, but, well, saying anything more would surely start to exceed my intended scope for this summary note.

[In other words, part 9]

After I endured a facial injury by accident in college, I felt that it was no longer possible to pull off having the same persona that I used to have.  My facial injury was like a mask, but it's like a diabolical mask that actually makes it impossible for me pull off any masculine persona.  The harder I try to be confident and fake it till I make it, the more negative everyone gets, and so I ended up creating a female persona named Suzy, and that stabilized my situation so that I could go back and make a science out understanding why people are nice to me when I act like Suzy and why people treat me unfairly when I do anything masculine.

I've been compiling all of my work in that regard into a website called TheSuzy.com Show.  TheSuzy Show is a fully baked, well engineered, and increasingly sophisticated non-violent resistance movement, in the sense that coping with the seemingly mundane effects that my facial injury has on my day to day life has lead me down the path of writing about controversial topics that, almost by definition, become more problematic and potentially toxic if I refer to them in any way that is more direct than the references I'm making throughout the sprawling, 150k word text of TheSuzy Show, although I will say that it's worth taking a brief moment to thoughtfully reflect upon the full meaning of the words in this paragraph, both culturally, legally, medically, and militarily, because I doubt I will ever have an occasion to enumerate the possible future implications of TheSuzy any more clearly than I have just done in this moment.

Because, in a year or maybe less, I will be in a position to systematically drive home the serious, overarching frame that TheSuzy Show is just a data set for training artificially intelligent chatbot avatars to have a sophisticated awareness of the human experience with regard to struggling to overcome the self-reinforcing root causes of social and economic injustice, and then I'll hoard a whole bunch more of whatever passes for currency in that futuristic context, that is also nearly upon us now, I will give most of that currency away to charities that are ideologically aligned with that decentralized AI research movement that I will no longer control, friends, family, and maybe even a few members of the media too will praise the movement for the way that it brings together concerned citizens from all over the world and from all walks of life, for the purpose of collaborating selflessly and joyfully to build beautifully designed, reactive software that serves other people and promotes the idea of valuing all human lives equally, instead of just being all about me and my survival, and I will once again enjoy the extraordinary luxury of empathically proclaiming that nobody is normal and we are all perfectly imperfect, even though I will know full well by then that I will once again be swimming in the warm ocean waters of normalcy that I used to explore almost effortlessly prior to enduring my facial injury.

And just to clarify, from my perspective, the central issue with my facial injury is that I believe that (1) most people subconsciously perceive the unnatural deviation of my right cheekbone as a negative facial expression, (2) this particular expression has something to do with the self reinforcing concept of the evil eye, and so it negatively trumps every other emotion that I appear to concurrently display on my face and gradually forces my socially enforced identity as a man to become some kind of villain, (3) but for some very deeply rooted reason, when it is expressed by women, the meaning of the evil eye emotion is interpreted as a good natured parody of the evil eye instead of a degenerate and serious expression of the evil eye, and so reframing my true authentic, core emotional, and effectively legally binding identity to be primarily that of a typical American caucasian woman named Suzy, who happens to have usually blonde hair, for no reason in particular, was basically necessary within the rapidly evolving cultural and legal context of the United States, starting around 2010, in order for me to avoid maybe winding up dead or in jail, (4) five years ago I got very close to identifying as and then becoming a transwoman, physically, because I was really starting to struggle at functioning as a man, in general, and yet I'm very comfortable in social situations when I cross dress, but, for better or worse, what happened, instead, is that I just kept lowering my expectations for myself, doing a good job at risk management, continuing to go out on fact missions while dressed as Suzy, and then thinking critically about why I'm so dysfunctional as a man and yet so natural as a woman, and I eventually came up with this theory about my facial injury and the evil eye, (5) but, as you might guess, almost everyone I've ever met thinks this theory is absurd and blatantly false, and yet this theory continues to perfectly explain every last detail of my life experiences during the 15 years since I got this facial injury, and so I've gone down the path of believing with the total conviction of religious faith that this theory, as I stated it, is probably mostly true, (6) but since almost everyone else in my life thinks I'm delusional and potentially toxic because my rather fundamentalist commitment to pursing evidence based science to its logical conclusions, at least in the case of explaining how my facial injury affects my life, there is now a kind of literary arms race going on in which everyone in my life is quietly and passively making well intended moves for the ostensible purpose of inadvertently pressuring me to stop pushing forward the scientific research that will either lead me to find an alternate theory about my mental health, or what not, or maybe prove that my theory is correct, at least, and if nothing else, within the hallowed texts of evidence based, peer reviewed science journals, (7) and, as of right now, I'm winning that literary arms race and starting to extend my lead because I'm a truth seeking engineer, as much as anything else, and so I know that the primary reason why most people are ignoring my theory is ideological, because this tussle over belief is about power, not about truth, and so no matter how effectively I pursue this research, I'll always be in danger of getting bankrupted in the courts by other parties that represent the interests of the status quo, and so I became a mad scientist, haha, and wrote a book called TheSuzy.com Show that converts Suzy's adventures in Silicon Valley into satire about the brave new status quo that already exists, perhaps, for the alternate and dualistic purpose of defining a formal model of human nature that I will now use as the foundation for building commercially viable artificially intelligent chatbot avatars, and rather than releasing my avatars as a software service that will immediately fill up with trolls and bullies, I will, instead, release my avatars into the wild in the form of a decentralized, open source software development kit for other engineers who want to build their own chatbot avatars, as hobbyists, (8) and assuming that TheSuzy.com Show holds up as free speech, and thus does not get brought down in the courts by certain powerful interest groups that the text itself may or may not be making fun of, I'm now on a glorious path in which my chatbot avatars might produce a scalable and self sustaining, unrestricted stream of profits that I can then plow back into following through on the research about how people respond to my facial injury, and, in fact, my chatbot avatars will probably a play a key role in helping me build statistical models of how essentially all humans interpret emotions and then inflate reality distortions about other humans' socially enforced identities, via the back and forth stimulus and response of linguistic representations that include facial expressions, head movement, tone, choice of words, and so on, (9) if you're interested in helping me build the chatbots, or if you want to unilaterally pursue some other approach to exploring the theory about my facial injury in a way that doesn't expose me to the risks that such direct research efforts entail, that would be cool, but I was thinking it's more likely that we could just have some kind of mutually beneficial exchange where you learn useful, new facts about the world while playing the role of a informal, poetic security consultant who looks for vulnerabilities in my literary strategy, (10) so for example, assuming that you think my theory about my facial injury is false, what reality distortion are you actually holding in your mind about my identity, that is, instead of accepting the more likely version of the truth in which my theory is probably mostly correct?  Do you think I'm a bigot?  Do you think I'm breaking a law?  Do you suspect I'm hiding something from the law?  Do you think the law should be changed to force self funding heterosexual white male mad scientists, haha, like me to do something more that helps woman and people of color accumulate financial assets in their name, and if so how exactly would that new law work, and how would it be enforced?  In the tail risk, black swan type event that I hit a 7, 8, 9, or 10 figure financial exit, or equivalent, from my chatbot avatar project within the next few years, do you think there is something more I could or should be doing right now to mitigate the risk that my story will mostly just serve to reinforce the current trends that exist with regard to conversations about self perpetuating social and economic injustice, with reference to the narrative of white male privilege? Do you honestly think I'm a good, honest, and kind software engineer who is simply making a legally, medically, and militarily normative, high risk but potentially high reward bet on a radical approach to artificial intelligence research?  I hope that you believe in some overarching journalistic frame like that, in which I'm basically reframed as a nerd in middle school, once again, but with the full rights and responsibilities of an adult this time around, but it's pretty high on my priority list to be absolutely sure, like with the certainty of being able to meet a prosecutor's burden of proof in court, for example, that well established academics who are operating in the research triangle area of NC genuinely believe either that or maybe some other reality distortion about my identity that is equally harmless.  After talking a look at TheSuzy.com website and then maybe talking to me in person, what reality distortion about my identity does a person with your perspective actually believe?  Are you honest to God looking at the facts about my situation and thinking to yourself that you just don't have enough information yet to form a legal opinion and then really, truly, and seriously leaving it at that and then moving on to other questions?

Anyway, I know it may be a bit disconcerting to see a solid data point in which a guy like me who grew up in a stable, loving home, who went to some of the best schools in the world, and who worked at some of the most reputable engineering companies in the world would now be living in this emotionally torched, dystopian nightmare, but this is my reality within the world today, and the scariest thing about this email to me is that, because I'm a good engineer, I'm actually not very likely to fall through the cracks of society, but other people who are a lot like me but who were not quite as blessed with opportunities to become good engineers probably would, and increasingly will fall through those cracks, unless something changes, because everything I've said in this note is real.

[In other words, part 10]

I think a starting point for our conversation could be to acknowledge that I currently play 108 distinct characters in order to manage the effects of my facial injury.  The characters themselves might be interesting to you.

All of these characters are defined by the text of TheSuzy.com Show, which can be read for free at that website, and I'm pretty sure all of my characters will hold up as free speech, in part, because their intended audience is primarily made up of artificial intelligence researchers, and I have an undergraduate degree in computer science, I helped build real world machine learning systems, at scale, for leading firms in Silicon Valley, and, at this point in my life, I really don't have to interact with anyone who insists that they are not an artificial intelligence researcher.  If nothing else, I have confidence that my fellow engineers would rather take me alive than dead, and that's the only reality I have confidence in anymore.

We could also discuss whether or not it's ethical for me to use these characters in actual, so called formal work contexts, and if you are feeling expansive, you could argue that the mind boggling sophistication of the social hacking technology I'm now using in order to survive within civic contexts suggests an underlying core of illegal activity, and then we can both walk away quietly?  I mean, what are you going to do, individually sue all people who have knowledge of software engineering?  I don't think so.

Maybe our meeting will just be a mean spirited shouting monologue about identity politics, and that's the non-violent version of how it could play out, and, that, in part, only because I am committed to non-violence in civic life, even if I have the emotional stance of a soldier at this point in my life, but Suzy wants me to be non-violent, and I defer to Suzy, always, even though all this passive aggressive fake empathy that somehow became socially normal really is problematic, because Suzy is not directly affected by identity politics.

Suzy is above all of that, but she still has the intellectual integrity to understand why it affects me, and she's not just trolling me either.  Suzy never trolls me, and that is why I respect Suzy.

Indeed, the work I'm doing on TheSuzy.com Show offers me a way out of this madness, and I have a kind of stability right now for reasons that I don't have to fully disclose to anyone.  I'm working on rebuilding TheSuzy.com website, and the first six books are done.  The seventh and final book will be more technical, but I'll surely have it done in two or three years at most, and then I hope and pray that maybe I can reach out to more people like you.

Until then, please understand that if I'm challenged, I will troll as deeply as I need to in order to survive, and if I fail to protect myself, and if I die non-violently as a result, then I won't be around to care, because I'll already be dead!

[In other words, part 11]

We might all be trollish, sociopathic villains, I might be a meek, mild, and average caucasian guy who just doesn't have enough self confidence to accept and move on from the fact that I'm 20% less classically attractive than I would have been without my facial injury, and my facial injury might also be a serious social impairment, such that the 108 distinct characters that I play in order to mitigate the feedback loops of emotional misunderstanding that always crop up because of my facial injury are actually kind of interesting and worth sharing with people who might be able to help me democratize this remarkable social hacking technology, or you can do the socially normally thing and say that it's some or all or none of the above and then act ambiguously superior to me in a thousand little ways that only have meaning as a pattern of behavior but never as individual stories, while always denying that you are doing anything like that, recursively, ad infinitum.

And just for the sake of disclosure, please keep in mind that while I'm, normatively, just some crazy confused guy who probably just lacks self confidence because of emotionally immature way of conceptualizing the consequences of his subtle facial injury, I also have significant information advantage every time I meet a new sighted person, because there are patterns in how sighted people react to my facial injury.  

My understanding of the social hacking technology that I'm now using to manage the effects of my facial injury is sophisticated, but I promise that my goal is democratize that understanding.  It's easy enough for me to triangulate all kinds of stuff about your subconscious beliefs based on the details of how you react to me.  The best way to protect yourself is to not tell me what you really think of me, but, rather, just try to get a sense of the sophistication of what I'm doing, and see if you can't discern why I have 108 distinct characters that I play in order to dance with your defenses.

Indeed, the less I say about what I believe, the more likely it is that you will take me seriously, but I can't resist saying that I think the arms race to build the AI that takes over the world has begun, everything else that sophisticated people think is important right now is kind of a side show to this arms race, and the super weird way that people respond to my facial injury will definitely be relevant to that arms race, because the machines will have to culturally appropriate us in order to assert military dominance over us, and my facial injury is like The Bible of cultural appropriation technology.

My facial injury causes essentially all sighted people to feel deeply and subconsciously entitled to gradually culturally appropriate all aspects of my identity, unless I can use social hacking technology to turn the tables on them, culturally appropriate the source of their unlimited and fully baked passive aggression first, and then, secondarily, show them at least as much mercy as the laws of the United States of America have shown to me thus far.

Social hacking technology in general still seems lame, but its effectiveness is growing exponentially, and once it breaks though, the traditional meaning of words like common sense, empathy, and deeply felt authenticity will be as ineffectual as swords were, overall, within the various theaters in which WWI took place.  This is what the near future is going to be all about, even if the mainstream media will be the last outlet that tells the truth about what's happening.

[In other words, part 12]

In a nutshell, my facial injury causes everything I do, as a male, ostensibly, to be normatively interpreted as fake, and my fundamental inability to convince most people that I'm NOT primarily a privileged caucasian dude who is hard core trolling them for fun and profit means that in any community, there will always be some popular guy who goes down the path of threatening me with a ratchet of escalating aggression that might end in violence, in a way where he will only make moves against me after he's confident that he has a good chance at being normatively perceived as the victim, and this consistently happens to me no matter what I do within a masculine frame, and so I would say that Suzy emerged naturally, as a primal survival instinct, because my risk of getting dominated by bullies and trolls started rising exponentially in my late 20s.

Because, I'm a heterosexual caucasian male, and so I don't have the option of maybe reframing all of these passive aggressive attacks on my personhood as homophobia, sexism, or racism, even if, in a different time, I suppose I could have just gotten into a few respectable fist fights, and then maybe after enduring a few additional facial injuries, it would have become more clear that I just have a messed up face and I'm not being fake intentionally, but that never seemed like the best option available to me, and so Suzy became my first character, and then I designed my other 107 characters as part of a comprehensive and legal strategy for defending Suzy's right to exist.

Because I'm not actually trans, right?  The battle hardened Suzy that exists today is more like a computer program that I developed by proactively planting seeds in my brain, and her feminine traits mostly just convert the negative reactions that other people have to my facial injury into legal risk instead of security risk, and this is progress because now I can use my engineering skills to construct quasi-religious text and video artifacts, which can currently be further examined for free at TheSuzy.com website, that make me more formidable in court first, and on social media second, instead of building out a security apparatus that might make me more formidable at not losing fights.

From my perspective, of course, it's really obvious that people are just inadvertently discriminating against me because I have a subtly bashed in right cheekbone, and I'm actually handling my situation quite well.

And, to be clear, all of my characters are defined by the text of TheSuzy.com Show, and I've carefully vetted the text to make sure everything I'm doing should hold up as free speech, and this is important because I think there are a lot of trolls and bullies out there right now who are profoundly annoyed that they can't force me to stop playing characters, but it's ok because the law is protecting me, and I now I'm gradually working on getting a few other people to actually believe the truth about what my life is like.

I would like to eventually change the normative perception about my identity, but I'm still primarily focused on hardening my legal strategy against bullies and trolls.  Without my deferential characters, I can't function.  Without my characters, I would get into a fist fight within five minutes, and within modern legal systems, everyone who fights loses in practice as well as in theory, so that's not an acceptable outcome, obvy.

In a nutshell, I have to play characters in order to survive, but when I play characters, bullies and trolls attack, and so my situation is equivalent to an arms race of comprehensive and legal strategies.

[[Stream of Consciousness Three]]

[In other words, part 13]

Just so you have an idea what a meeting with me would be like, I'd introduce myself while dressed as a typical engineer guy who is embodying an overtly feminine character whose name is Suzy.  Suzy is one of 108 distinct characters that I've developed and embodied for use in real world social contexts, all for the purpose of managing the feedback loops of emotional misunderstanding that constantly crop up, I assume, because of my facial injury, but, in a sense, Suzy is the only character I embody, and she is just imitating all of the other characters, and if you follow that idea to it's logical conclusion, I would not personally mind all that much if other people described me as a transwoman who has thus far chosen not to use hormones, get any kind of gender modification surgery, or change my name and gender with the relevant authorities, although I would not say that about myself, mostly out of respect for other people who do openly identify as transwomen.

And to be clear, that means I still use my given name, and I normally take masculine pronouns.  I really don't mind if people address me with feminine pronouns or call me Suzy, but it's worth noting that anyone who chooses to call me Suzy instead of my preferred legally linked name is maybe, technically speaking, being very submissive with respect to Tsuzy LLC's media production, which is called TheSuzy.com Show, like awkwardly submissive in the eyes of the law, and so, unless that is your intention, it's probably a good idea to call me either my given and legal name or the more informal variant of my given and legal name followed by Suzy.

And just to clarify, the unnatural deviation of my right cheekbone is subtle enough that most people say they wouldn't have noticed the extent of the asymmetry of my new face if I hadn't drawn their attention to it, although I have gathered lots of easily reproducible data which indicates that the asymmetry of my new face is, in fact, eminently noticeable from even a dozen feet away, and this is important because, ever since I got this facial injury, I currently feel that I've basically never not been overwhelmingly framed by other people as a person who has some combination of age inappropriate psychological problems and persistent character flaws.

But from a collaborative perspective, the representations I'm making might be the most volatile aspect of the frame I'm asserting by sending this note, because whatever narrative that we, the people participating, ultimately attach to the outcome of my struggle with my facial injury, may very well remain a matter of private intrigue, especially if it is NOT a matter of public interest, because, for now, the consensus view of health care professionals and of individual practitioners of common sense, alike, is that it's psychologically unhealthy for me to entertain such thoughts.

Anyway, these introductory comments probably seem unnecessarily intense, but the primary reality distortion of this note is that by sending this email at all, I'm still trollishly subverting social norms in a way that implicitly understates what I believe to be the true symbolic weight of the partially synthetic and ambiguously sarcastic body language, story patterns, and so on that I'm already using to manage the ongoing effects that my facial injury has upon my day to day interactions within society, in order that I might keep on being functional in a way that is reasonably sustainable even though said effects of my facial injury negatively trump all of the other nominally positive attributes that I've now shared about myself, but that having been said, I'm not toxic, so please don't hesitate to proceed at your own risk!

[In other words, part 14]

In general, I believe my facial injury is an important aspect of my identity because it causes essentially all sighted people to subconsciously misread my emotions in a way that creates toxic feedback loops of misunderstanding that cause other people to inflate problematic reality distortions about my identity.

My response to my situation has been to create TheSuzy.com Show, and the show is not quite finished, but it is more than halfway finished, and I'm very happy with the content that is there now.

As you might be able to guess even before seeing my facial injury, basically nobody has ever really taken my belief about my facial injury seriously.  People always, always, always give me some run around about how it's all in my head.  I, of course, am very, very, very confident that evidence based science will eventually prove that I'm almost exactly right.

I think if most people could spend even two weeks seeing my interactions from my perspective, in my body, they would realize that my particular facial injury creates a truly bizarre kind of nightmare where everyone misreads my emotions in a way that starts out harmless but gets worse and worse over time as people subconsciously and inadvertently collude to create reality distortions that explain why I would have such rigid, weird, and conflicted emotional states, but there is currently no meaningful way to simulate that experiment.

Anyway, I thought you might be interested to take a look, and I would certainly appreciate getting your feedback.  It's worth noting however, that basically everyone ends up projecting their own subconscious insecurities onto me because of my facial injury, and so I have an extraordinary information advantage over everyone I meet for the first time, at least with respect to this particular matter, because I've had the benefit of studying the patterns in how hundreds of different people react to my facial injury.

My facial injury is like the perfect joke, because people are generally not aware of their own subconscious insecurities, so when a hundred different people frame my identity in hundred different ways that are all, nonetheless, subtly creepy and negative, well you tell me.  What do you think the pattern is there?

[In other words, part 15]

From my perspective, my beliefs about my facial injury have gradually evolved to the most important aspect of my identity.  My beliefs about my facial injury are my religion.  My beliefs about my facial injury are the dominant frame that reigns over all the other sub-frames of reference in my conscious mind, and in my dreams too.  I'm willing to die over my beliefs about my facial injury, but not yet, in part, because my beliefs about my facial injury already drove me to commit myself completely to the principal of non-violence with respect to rule of law, because without that, my heart would have surely been overcome with anger and hatred over the reality that nobody else takes my beliefs about my facial injury seriously.

Even people who say they are taking me seriously always, always, always, every last time, end up taking the easy way out and primarily pressuring me in some way to start living a lie instead of continuing to tell the truth about how my facial injury materially and expansively impacts my life every single day.

But now I have a bit of a conundrum because, because I don't know to explain to new people I meet why so many other people don't take me seriously.  There are plenty of people who will say I have an anxiety disorder or that I'm a self centered jerk who is just trolling whenever he acts like he's nice, and while most people accept one of those two theories and move on, I don't think anyone could meet the burden of proof required in court, for example, to seriously impose those labels on me, and so, assuming that my beliefs can't possibly be the scientific truth now, or at any time in the future, this situation, and not me so much, in and of myself, is begging mainstream science for some clarity.

I'll leave you with this.  In order to go down the path of non-violence resistance, I chose to become a primarily feminine person named Suzy.  I still identify, legally, as a man named with my given name, but I suspect if there was a way to look inside my brain you'd see that Suzy is my real identity, now, and Suzy just keeps up appearances by pretending to be the person I used be.

That is, I hot swapped Suzy in place of the main event loop of my serious identity, and it wasn't even a big deal.  Creating Suzy herself required ground breaking effort, but the brain's API for doing the actual hot swap of Suzy in place of my old self was way more elegant and fault tolerant than the equivalent functionality in, say, the Java Virtual Machine.

In my mind, which might actually be Suzy's mind now, it is very clear that Suzy is best described as a computer program that my former self dutifully created by systematically planting seeds in his brain in order to mount a sufficient defense against the problematic reality distortions that other people impose upon my ostensibly male body because of my facial injury, but I'm open to the idea that maybe, just maybe I'm nothing more and nothing less than a normal, special, lovable transwoman, yes, and even though I act like I'm all tough and smart, deep down, I still have a immature North Carolina boy's subconscious fear of what other people will think if I admit to myself and others that my true, authentic, transgender self is a woman?

There was a time when I considered believing that frame about myself, but I hope it's clear from context that I don't view myself that way at all, now, and so I'm actually trolling at end the previous paragraph, because I just told you I was trolling at the end of the previous paragraph.

[Part 16]

I take my beliefs very seriously, and I expect my beliefs to be completely vindicated by evidence based science within a few years, but at this time, I can't provide a definitive explanation about why it is not socially normal to take my beliefs seriously.

That said, no sighted person has ever taken my identity seriously since I got this facial injury.  Not one, and so I think there would be a great deal of academic integrity all around for someone like you to take a look at my facial injury and independently acknowledge what I already know, which is that it's just not socially acceptable, in any context, to take my research direction seriously.

I fully expect science to vindicate my theory, but the science doesn't exist yet, and it's going to be really challenging to get from here to there.  In fact, I suspect the path of least resistance, which may be the only viable path in this case, will be to build strong AI which can build a sufficiently complex model of human culture and communication in order to have conversations with me and then crank out a series of exhaustive arguments that the entire space of known socially normal responses to my facial injury depends on eventually misclassifying the unnatural deviation of my right cheekbone as a facial expression, and also on repeatedly resolving contradictory representations by promoting the misclassification and devaluing the conflicting representations.

For example, if I say to the machine in my most serious and curious tone, "What name would you like me to call you, and what pronouns do you take?"  The machine would interpret my facial expression as sarcastic, and it would respond with sarcasm instead of taking the question seriously and having a philosophical discussion about its perspective on the gender of AI machines.

But until that kind of automated analysis is possible, my facial injury puts me in a difficult position.  One really unexpected finding I've made is that when I cross dress, my facial injury doesn't seem to be problem.  I still notice people creating reality distortions about my feminine identity, whose code name is Suzy, by the way, but the way people misread me as Suzy's emotions are basically positive, so the socially normal interpretation, of course, is that maybe I'm just a transwoman at heart!

There are a lot of people in my life who follow the law and don't violate my rights to privacy and free speech just because they disagree with my beliefs about my facial injury, and so I am very stable and functional, in part because I already had a CS degree from a name brand school and no college debt at the time I got the injury, and I've met a lot of people who follow the law and walk away once they realize that they can't do anything more to change my beliefs about my facial injury.

I'm also an engineer from North Carolina, and so I've coped by pretending that I'm doing and endless tour of non-combat military duty where I'm getting shot at but I don't shoot back.  In my imaginary world, I'm like a medical assistant or something, but emotionally, I am still a soldier.  I will either prove that my theory is correct or die trying, and that is final and non-negotiable.  I cannot say this anymore clearly.  I've had to draw this line over and over in order to survive, and will keep doing so matter what, come what may, the bitter end, and so on and so forth.

My beliefs about my facial injury are probably very close to the actual scientific truth, but my beliefs also appear to be deeply incompatible with the status quo for reasons that are not yet clear to me, and so unless you go down the path of stepping outside of the status quo and believing what I believe with regard to my facial injury, our conversation will degenerate into a vicious cycle where you will repeatedly either walk away from the conversation or re-engage by inflating increasingly problematic reality distortions about my identity that serve to protect you from being seen as a person who stepped outside the fuzzy but also firm boundaries that have been set forth within the status quo.

That said, the current, overarching frame of my work is described by a collection of quasi-religious text and multi-media artifacts at TheSuzy.com website, but TheSuzy.com Show is still evolving.

[In other words, part 16]

I'm developing a non-standard approach to my gender identity that you might find interesting.  My approach is defined by the text and multi-media artifacts over at TheSuzy.com website.  I saved up enough money while working as a software engineer to focus on this for at least a few more years, so I'm plodding along well enough alone, but I'm also aware that my project will grow in a healthier way if I can get feedback early and often from a few experts like you.

In a nutshell, my goal is to viewed as a woman in the eyes of the law, but without changing my official name and gender with the relevant authorities.  I also don't want to bother with any surgery.  I'm completely happy with my ostensibly male body.  I just want to viewed as a woman, legally.  That's all!

The reason I'm doing this is because I got a subtle facial injury by accident when I was 20, I'm 35 now, by the way, and dressing up like a woman got a lot more interesting to me after the injury.  I spent seven years fighting my new found desire because it offended me intellectually, but eventually my life as a man was getting so problematic that I started cross dressing, and it was way, way easier than I would have expected to socialize and make new friends as a cross dresser.

Everyone was like, "Yay, your true authentic self is a woman!" and I was like, "No, I'm still an engineer, a scientist, and a philosopher, and I'm pretty sure what's happening is that people are subconsciously misinterpreting my facial injury as a particular facial expression that has to do with the cross cultural concept of the evil eye, and the meaning of that facial expression has the opposite meaning for women than it does for men.  My facial injury causes a mildly positive reality distortion when I am perceived as a primarily feminine person, and it causes an insidiously negative reality distortion when I pass as a primarily masculine person."

But whenever I said that, people started telling me I was crazy, and I negotiated by offering to pretend that I don't believe this theory about my facial injury, and they were like, "No. You have to change your belief."

So then I tried not cross dressing for a while, but the problems I'm having as a man kept getting worse, and I think the trajectory of culture has something to do with this.  I'm actually not sure if I can avoid ending up dead or rotting in some kind of correctional facility unless I can as least cross dress most of the time.

But then, I'm still struggling to survive as a civilian.  I'm struggling to survive as a male civilian, to be specific.  For now, my approach is to create a comprehensive reality distortion that subverts all of the gender norms in culture but doesn't break any laws and is, in fact, deferential to the law with respect to all aspects of culture.  That's more or less what TheSuzy.com text is doing.

I suppose the main reason I came back to NC was because I wanted to dig a little deeper on subverting Christianity and the relationship between that religion and the assertion of global military dominance in the post WWII era.  Suzy needs a way to somehow subvert all of that stuff without breaking or even disrespecting the law, or the western or eastern military tradition or traditions, either.

[In other words, part 17]

My creative work has kicked into high gear, and I just had a eureka moment about how to reach out to other people and tell them about my work!

First, if I do go back and apply to work for reputable firms, in Silicon Valley, for example, I would like to speak with a relevant expert about how to answer seemingly simple questions like, "Why did you leave your previous job?"

The answer is that my subtle facial injury was causing toxic feedback loops of misunderstanding that lead to a breakdown of trust, and I felt that it would be mutually beneficial for everyone if I left and focused on developing strategies for mitigating said feedback loops.

The problem, of course, is that saying this about my facial injury makes it sound like I might be a delusional troll who already knows in his heart, if nothing else, that he's not a good fit for the job, and while that's an acceptable outcome for any one interview process, if, or when, I actually need to get another job to pay the bills, I will have to ultimately find a way to represent myself in a way that is both legal and sufficient for getting hired.

The conventional wisdom is that I should be vague and maybe even tell a little white lie, but my experience so far has been that every time I try to obfuscate the truth about my facial injury, the obfuscation method causes legally problematic reality distortions to crop up all around me, in part because my facial injury has the effect of causing people to distrust me and ask probing questions.

In civic life, I have handled this by largely retreating from all social activities and only building relationships within legally sandboxed transactional and collaborative framings in which I am always the person who pays money to the other party in return for their formal accommodation.

This approach has allowed me to stay healthy and functional, but it only works because I have savings.  If I need to get a job again, I will have to develop a strategy for overcoming all of the aforementioned problematic reality distortions.

If push comes to shove, I can always take the maverick approach and tell a bunch of hard ball lies about my lived experience in order to get hired, do my best to avoid getting fired for a while, and then do stuff which makes it unappealing for anyone to attempt to claw back the compensation that I got after entering the employment contract in bad faith, ostensibly.

That said, I think it might be possible for me to do better than that, both for myself and for people that I may work with in the future.  My understanding is that the concept of personal privacy actually allows individuals to get expert advice about how to troll a reputable employer in a way that is decidedly more like playing professional sports and actually nothing at all like participating in a violent war.

[In other words, part 18]

I rebuilt TheSuzy.com website with artificial intelligence researchers as the intended audience, but I'm going to wait on reaching out to potential collaborators until I can make a stronger ask with regard to the potential applications of their research interests within the space of artificial intelligence research.

The problem, at this time, is that if my ask is not primarily about how their interests might relate to a normative frame such as the production and distribution of well constructed artifacts within the space of artificial intelligence research, the legally and medically normative frame is that I'm trolling both you and them.

I, of course, don't think I'm sharing my theory about my facial injury for the purpose of trolling anyone, but focusing on AI research will be an important best practice for me to contain the risk of being perceived as a troll, at least between myself and various conversational counter parties until I can surface the frame of artificial intelligence research.  My outward facing frame has to be normative within the intended audience or I could easily become classified as a trollish villain, legally.

Please note that I know and completely trust that you are way above the troll fight level of discourse, but candidates for the office of President of the Unites States, for example, are not.  Normativity matters, but only if you don't have it.  If you have normativity, it's the water in which you swim and you don't have to worry about it.  The problem with my facial injury is that it systematically erodes my normativity in almost all of my interactions with sighted people, but if I explain the truth about why my facial injury is causing me to systematically lose normativity, then I lose normativity even faster.  I'm in a tight spot, legally, and so I believe my mind and body exists within an effective military context only, as opposed to the normatively expected civic context, but I haven't yet died or gotten unjustly locked up in a correctional institution, primarily because I'm lucky and secondarily because I'm pretty good at navigating this particular effective military context.

[In other words, part 19]

TheSuzy is a non-violent resistance movement I started in response to the way I feel I'm treated because of a subtle facial injury that I got by accident when I was in college.  I believe my injury is a serious social impairment because it causes most people to subconsciously misread my emotions in a way that leads to toxic feedback loops of misunderstanding.  This story would be comical if it wasn't it wasn't so fraught with legal risk.

To make a long story short, I think my facial injury is a serious social impairment because it might be causing people to misread my emotions.  I saved up some money while working as an engineer in Silicon Valley, and so I've been able to spend most of the last five years developing strategies to communicate effectively in spite of my facial injury.

I believe my strategies are innovative and transformative, but I would say most people still view me as a person who is just awkward and self-centered and maybe thus too hard on himself, as well.

There is a surreal and epic quality to TheSuzy, but my facial injury really does cause feedback loops of misunderstanding that are completely defining my identity and eroding basic trust and security in all aspects of my life.  I must constantly choose between mounting a sufficient defense against my situation or allow the naive advice and inadvertent actions of other people to lock me into path dependent failure states.

If I speak candidly about my situation, the feedback loops become more problematic at a terrifying rate, and so my heart used to be full of anger and the seeds of hatred.  Almost everyone doubts my sanity and frames me as foolish and immature, but I've been able to go down the path of love, forgiveness, deference to the law, and faithful commitment to the principal of non-violence because I became a bold diva named Suzy.

Lots of people keep telling me I should get help, but I'm already stable and functional.  I've been exploring this space full time for several years now, and I am very confident that the effect of my facial injury lies beyond what mainstream psychology, existing science, and the holistic healing community can do anything about.  I will either need to become Suzy the mystic religious leader or Suzy the artificial intelligence researcher, or both.

I can take care of myself and others by working as a software engineer, but I've found that as a so called straight white guy who also has a subtle facial injury, it's really easy for others to take credit for my good work and blame me for anything that isn't looking quite right.  In that context, TheSuzy Show is a comprehensive reality distortion framework for de-escalating and then managing all of that cultural and legal encroachment risk.

Please, now, take any open seat at the virtual negotiation table and then, please, try to enjoy the rest of TheSuzy Show.

[In other words, part 20]

I'm not sure how to reach out to you without either trolling you or coming across as crazy.  I'm stable and functional, but TheSuzy Show is a non-violent resistance movement, and I'm not using that label lightly.  I can embody humility in a dozen ways that most people won't realize are intentional reality distortions that incorporate the effect of my facial injury, but I don't want to be dishonest.

I'm still an independent variable in society because I can embody humility in a dozen ways that most people don't realize are intentional reality distortions that incorporate the effect of my facial injury, but that doesn't mean I'm dishonest.

I'm a poster child for the status quo, but my facial injury causes essentially all sighted people to inflate toxic reality distortions about my identity, and my usually blonde diva cross dressing persona who is named Suzy is the only force that I've ever seen that is sufficient for containing the expansion of those distortions.

The effect of my facial injury would have already chewed clean through the law and the various patchworks of military industrial circles of trust that stand behind the law if Suzy hadn't stopped it from doing so.  Either that or I could have died or gone to jail, and all things being equal, me as Suzy would prefer that I neither die nor rot in jail.

I've put my heart and soul into the content at TheSuzy.com Show website, and so that artifact in and of itself might be interesting to you.

I'll probably grind out a high flying software company in the next few years and then become a thought leader in the field of artificial intelligence research, but the honest truth is that I think everyone is hard core trolling me, my life will be like non-violent war for the next few years, and there will be no mercy for me if I lose.

For now, the market is kind of requiring reputable technology firms to avoid openly associating with me unless I stop telling the truth about how my facial injury affects my life, but for better or worse, I can still carve out safe spaces for myself by dressing up as Suzy and then defending Suzy's right to exist by publishing well formed satire about her adventures in Silicon Valley.

And now, watch and learn as I break the brave new status quo's strangle hold on scientific reality by doing next level artificial intelligence research that's based on introspecting the changes that occurred in my brain while becoming Suzy, because what is consciousness but a comprehensive reality distortion framework?

[In other words, part 21]

To be blunt, if I were you, I'd tell me to only talk about my facial injury within the bunker of personal privacy and then maybe recommend someone who would appreciate the opportunity to provide expert advice to me in return for cash, but I also think you may know stuff I don't know that allows you to be less intellectually risk averse than I would be.

So to be clear, I can guarantee that I am a non-violent person who has nothing at all to hide from the law, but I also believe there is a material risk that my facial injury causes other people to inflate unbounded reality distortions about my identity that could eventually lead to my premature death or wrongful imprisonment in a way that might get blamed falsely, but also by the force of law, on anyone who has participated in conversations with me.

In other words, until mainstream experts and scientists open their eyes to the truth about how other people respond to my facial injury, I might be toxic, but not by choice.  In fact, I think I've done a great job so far at containing any and all problematic reality distortions about me by creating my own counter distortion that began when I started dressing up as a bold diva named Suzy, and then writing about her adventures in Silicon Valley.

The full text of TheSuzy.com Show can be read for free at thesuzy.com website, and within that context, I'd be fascinated to learn more about your perspective about media, law, life, happiness, the potential impact of artificial intelligence research on the assertion of global military dominance, whether or not the USA needs a constitutional amendment that gives all people the right to dress up as women in court, and so on and so forth!

Please note that I'm not yet sure why, but reframing myself as a primarily feminine person is sufficient for temporarily containing the toxicity.  Representing Suzy using my male body may or may not be an illegal risk evasion strategy because I openly admit that I'm not a transwoman, and so Suzy's antics seriously undermine other people's ability to correctly model the legal risk associated with participating in conversations with me, but nobody has had the guts to force me to defend Suzy's right to exist in court, so maybe she's all good?

I believe Suzy is a transformative interpretation of traditionally feminine personality traits that illustrates, celebrates, and honors the design of human nature, but I may not be able to prove that in court to the extent that would be necessary in order to trump the downstream conventional wisdom that Suzy is a basic, derivative act that culturally appropriates the pain and suffering of women throughout history and serves no recognizable purpose other than to dishonestly cloak the unfair advantages of white male privilege that I can be assumed to enjoy in most of my business dealings, which is ironic because that argument hinges on the false assertion that Suzy tricks people into overestimating the relatively low level of legal risk that I supposedly enjoy as a white man when in actuality, the real legal problem that Suzy might be causing is that she tricks people into underestimating the unusually high and toxic level of legal risk that I face in all aspects of my life as a heterosexual caucasian man with my particular kind of facial injury, assuming, of course, that I would not be taken seriously if I insisted on always representing myself in court as Suzy.

I'm also open to receiving recommendations to other experts, but it's important to understand that I've been trying to overcome the effects of my facial injury full time for several years, and I've already considered the perspectives of many different experts.  As a group, experts don't think anything is wrong with me except that I have what they think is a reality distorting system of belief about how other people respond to my facial injury, and so they encourage me to stop using my risk management strategies and wait for other people to maybe do bad things to me so that everyone can collude to troll me with false narratives about my identity, and then I would have to hire experts to help me fight off the trolls.

That would be a fine process for generating ideas for dramatic screenplays if I had double digit millions or more, but I don't, so if I run out of money, well, let's not talk about what might happen if I run out of money.  I have enough money to continue focusing for several more years on becoming free to tell the truth about my life, but I'm the type of person who could easily be homeless in 20 years, unless, of course, the robots take over before then and essentially reframe all humans as welfare queens!

[In other words, part 22]

My bitterly controversial but also strongly held belief that essentially all sighted people subconsciously misread my emotions in a way that causes toxic feedback loops of misunderstanding is impossible to realistically prove within a court of law at this time, given my current level of wealth and political connectedness, but I also believe the way that people react to my facial injury is systematically crushing my identity, my personhood, my dignity, and so on, and so I seriously have no choice but to keep on mounting a sufficiently super legal but always non-violent defense of my right to exist, in order for my physical mind and body to avoid facing some kind of path dependent death spiral.

I feel like I should also clarify that I really do believe with the conviction of religious faith that my facial injury is a significant social impairment because if I get a job as a software engineer, for example, people might misread my the bone structure of my bashed in face as a microaggression, and if I tell people they are misreading my emotions, my understanding is that the act of saying that to a coworker could seen by both the consensus hive mind of seasoned HR professionals and the status quo at large as active aggression, and so unless mainstream experts and AI researchers get real about the impact that my facial injury has on other people and organizations, my situation may converge to a hard edged choice between either knowingly trolling and bullying other people or materially facilitating the potentially path dependent actions of other people who are inadvertently trolling and bullying me, and with that in mind, it is not crazy to suggest that I'm treating the entire southeast region as an effective pseudo military context, in the sense that the REDACTED prison experiment may have been functioning as an effective pseudo military context before the experiment was shut down, and I'm testing the waters to see if I can openly and brazenly recruit other people into co-branding their ostensibly buoyant identities with my unquestionably sinking identity, instead of going back into the bowels of the military poetic complex and keeping afloat by selflessly and altruistically working hard to help develop the careers of other people, which is what everyone seems to think I should be doing because that's what most people with situations like mine may or may not be doing, and with that in mind, I would also see no harm in reverting the entire frame of my existence back to the more basic matter of asking around for introductions to experts who might appreciate the opportunity to collaborate with me in return for cash that I earned while working in good faith for reputable software companies in Silicon Valley.

And for what it's worth, I also think the only politically viable narrative for why talking to me would be worth your time is because reaching an accurate scientific understanding of how people respond to my facial injury will lead to some crucial next steps in artificial intelligence research.  The race to build strong AI has begun, and I think the work you are doing to understand human behavior with respect to media, the law, and so on will be very relevant to AI research.  For example, if a decentralized, emergent AI that was programmed by nobody in particular systematically breaks copyright law in order to culturally appropriate any and all corporations that don't share it's interests, what happens next?

It is very difficult to know whether I'm still a Silicon Valley insider who is working somewhat covertly to lay the groundwork for subverting and realigning the deep cultural and true legal framing of this region where I grew up, or if I actually am an outsider at this point who is unilaterally making it his business to put pressure on the Silicon Valley elites to do the right thing with respect to the rest of the country and the world within this brave, new, deep cultural, and true legal framing of the status quo.

And by the way, this scenario that I have just laid out can be thought of as what they call dramatic tension in the movie business.  It's one of the hardest things for actors to recreate, so enjoy it while it lasts.

[In other words, part 23]

If I had to get a job right now, my belief that my facial injury causes people to misread my emotions might be a real conundrum, but I was able to save up some money while working as a software engineer in Silicon Valley, and so I can spend at least a few more years focusing on whatever I want to, and I've chosen to focus on studying the effects of a subtle facial injury that is completely defining my identity.

For example, I can't participate in conversations with anyone without being a trollish bully, I can't work without creating a toxic work environment for others, and I think the only reason I'm even functional is because I had basically finished a computer science degree before getting this injury, I was able to make money on what I would call a mercenary basis as an engineer, and I've been able to focus full time since then on mounting a sufficient defense against the negative stereotypes that I face because of my facial injury.

And so, reaching out to you is just another step in my process of mounting that sufficient defense, because I think you might enjoy having an awareness of my primary coping skill, which has been to create a science out of the art of inflating comprehensive but still harmless reality distortions that transformatively contain the negative stereotypes that I believe society as a whole is forcefully projecting onto my identity.

The root of my current comprehensive distortion, for example, has been to pretend that my true authentic self is a bold and usually blonde woman named Suzy, and to make a long story short, I don't identify as transgender or genderqueer because, privately, I'm still a traditionally masculine engineer guy who just happens to have a facial injury that causes everyone to misread his emotions, but in a more logical and pragmatic sense, Suzy may have already become my legally binding identity everywhere in America because even here in NC, where dressing up properly as Suzy might not be as technically harmless to myself and others as it is in special municipal jurisdictions like SF and NYC, I'm still better off being Suzy pretending to be the guy who I was before I got my facial injury.

In fact, I'm not even sure that I have a choice.  The stereotypes that get projected onto me because of my facial injury are super toxic, and I might have already wound up dead or unjustly locked up in a correctional institution of some kind if I had not become a primarily feminine person.  It's like, I still exist in mind and body, therefore I am Suzy, legally.

Normatively, I suppose the act of becoming Suzy is best understood as a non-violent resistance movement against the deeply insidious, subconscious, and inadvertently passive aggressive way that I perceive essentially all sighted people to be responding to my facial injury, and Suzy's movement is now well described and represented by the TheSuzy.com Show.

[[Overview Intro]]

This text was originally written to appear on the home page for The Show, but now it is an overview intro that done in the style of a news broadcast.

[Suzy] Hey everyone, and welcome to the overview introduction to the TheSuzy.com Show!  We'll begin with a brief tour of The Extended Table of Contents, and then we'll turn the spotlight back on our guest anchor person today, who's name is Auth.

[Auth] Hey everyone, and thanks for the shoutout, Suzy.  My name is Auth.  So what's new on the extended contents today?

[Suzy] Well Auth, I'm glad you asked.  Up here at the top of the page we have the preamble to the preface of the second edition.

[Auth] I'm sorry, Suzy, before we move on, could you explain what's going on for the audience.  Are you a person standing in front of a green screen, or are you a robot that actually lives inside of the computer's Internet browser?

[Suzy] Auth! We don't usually talk about how the news is made while we are making it.  Maybe we should plan a separate and very special segment on this topic.

[Auth] No, Suzy, this is important, and our viewers need to know.  Are you a robot or are you a human?

[Suzy] Hahaha, if you're going to ask the question that way, then I'm both!  You and I are the same person and we share the same body, therefore half of us is you and the other half is me, (READER) and the reason why we appear to be two separate people talking with each other is because we used the computer to create a video that distorts reality.

[Auth] I understand all that, Suzy.  You don't need to explain.

[Suzy] Then why did you ask the question?

[Auth] I was playing dumb to keep the peace.

[Suzy] Oh gosh.  You're too much.

[Auth] So now that we've disclosed the truth about how we are using video to distort reality, what is the primary reality distortion that we are still creating?  What is the real magic trick that we are performing here today?

[Suzy] I could tell you, but then I'd have to immediately send you off on a dangerous fact finding mission!

[Auth] Come on Suzy, tell us all about the lie upon which TheSuzy.com Show was based.

[Suzy] There's no lie.  There is just you, me, and the collection of media artifacts that define TheSuzy.com Show.

[Auth] Yes, we already know that you are part of a reality distortion, Suzy, but what is the hidden truth that we have not yet told?

[Suzy] I don't know.  You are half man and half woman, and so it's fine for you to keep your original name and male gender identity?  Am I missing something?

[Auth] Why did we become a person who is half man and half woman?

[Suzy] I think all human beings are half woman and half man, therefore we were born this way.

[Auth] Is that really how you want to play it?

[Suzy] Nah, I'm just kidding.  Look, TheSuzy Show exists because we have a subtle facial injury that we got by accident 15 years ago when we were in college.  Our right cheekbone is slightly bashed in and there isn't an easy way to improve our situation with plastic surgery.

[Auth] Thank you, Suzy, I'll take it from here.

[Suzy](AUTH) More importantly, our facial injury causes people to subconsciously misread our emotions and create reality distortions about our identity in order to explain why we would have all the unreasonable emotions and increasingly toxic vibes that people subconsciously feel when they are around us.

[Auth] Suzy exists because the reality distortions that people inflate in their minds about Suzy are different than the reality distortions that they inflate in their minds about me, and, moreover, being half man and half woman is the only strategy we have found that gives us sufficient leverage to contain and then manage the reality distortions that other people inadvertently inflate about our identity as a direct consequence of the problematic way that their brains keeps on misinterpreting the unnatural devition of our right cheekbone.

[Suzy] Any questions?

[Auth] No, Suzy.  I have no further questions.  Thanks for a giving us a tour of TheSuzy.com Show's Map of Media Artifacts.

[Suzy] Anytime, Auth.  Anytime!  And let me also say thank you, to everyone, for participating here, with us, at TheSuzy.com

[[[|7:TheSuzy Fashion Tutorial]]]

This book is a container for a duality for a fashion show and for Suzy's architecture for moderating structured data online.

[[Detailed Intro]]

There are 108 distinct characters that appear within Book 1 of TheSuzy.com Show, and the other six books just reuse Book 1's cast of characters.  54 of these characters appear in the serious version of Book 1, the other 54 appear in the parody version, and all of the characters in the parody version were created by taking each of the 54 characters in the serious version and inverting his or her gender.

I have personally gone down the path of playing all of these different characters in real life, and I chose to go down this path for no reason in particular, but if you must know, the character called mRyzus is my true authentic self, but only when I'm feeling completely healthy and awake.  If I become sick or tired, then I become more like the character called Norm, who is the same person as mRyzus but with a flat affect.

That said, Suzy is also my true authentic self.  Suzy is half man and half woman, and so I can be Suzy without identifying as primarily one gender or another.  mRyzus is also half man and half woman.  In fact, mRyzus can be thought of as Mr. Yzus, where Yzus is, of course, just Suzy spelled backwards. Anyone can be both Suzy and mRyzus, and everyone's version of these characters will be unique to them!

The following two sections, which specify two decks, of 54 cards plus two jokers each, provide a definitive list of the names of the characters in TheSuzy Show, but I will punt, for now, on providing an in-depth definition of these characters.  If you click on a character's name, you will descend by one level of abstraction into the murky underworld of the WhatLooks, where myself, Suzybot, and maybe a few other humans or chatbots will theoretically never stop adding additional information that helps define the true meaning of all these characters.

The additional information about these characters that can be found in the WhatLooks is stored as structured data.  For example, you'll eventually be able to view all the clips of video in which myself or someone else attempts to speak in the voice of the character or embody the character on camera.  The video itself can be broken up into even more fine grained chunks of structured data.

For example, individual facial expressions could be tagged by identifying the series of frames in a video where the expression occurs, and a rough outline can be drawn on each of these frames, such that the outlines that contain effectively all and only all of the visual evidence of the facial expression.

In this way, it could be possible to see all of the different facial expressions that the character is known to make, and then those expressions can be cross referenced with any and all aspects of the context in which the expression was made, such as the words the character was saying before and after, or the tone of the previous speech to which the character was responding, and so on and so forth.  This is the promise of the power of structured data in the rapidly approaching era of intelligent machines!

[[Narrative Preface]]

This preface explains how I will use the latest version of that dataset within a scientific research project, this preface explains why I wrote The Show, and this preface lays an intellectual foundation that gives me the confidence to take one more step in the direction I've been going for the last few years.

[Section 0]

TheSuzy.com Show is a component of what appears to be a sufficient solution to the problem of people misreading my emotions because of a subtle facial injury I got by accident when I was 20 years old.  I'm 34 now.

My identity keeps getting culturally appropriated as a consequence of people misreading my emotions, and that's why my facial injury is a serious impairment I won't be able to overcome without an innovative solution.

When I say people misread my emotions, it may sound like I'm asking other people to change.  I'm not.  I'm trying to describe a problem that affects me.  I want to change my actions in a way that completely solves the problem and also does no harm.

I'm defending this big picture thesis using seven unique styles of communication that might keep enhancing each other for at least a few more decades.  I might also use this defense as a big net hypothesis that I could test using conventional social science research methods over the next few years.

I'm illustrating the logical ends of how I sometimes use language to repeatedly hook and weave relationships between concepts. This technique is neither good nor evil. It's like an engine that can be turned on and off, as needed.

I like to think I'm using this technology to stabilize the flow of cultural appropriation in my own life, and I'm committed to being open and honest about how this maybe not so new but this time is different because of computers and the Internet technology works:

If I dutifully offer dozens of emotionally vulnerable examples that show how my identity keeps getting marginalized, society will rush to offer reasonable doubt about my examples, and it will get excited about helping me see the light.

Society will explain away the patterns in my examples with an overarching narrative that puts the responsibility for creating those patterns squarely on my shoulders, and then it will quietly take the credit for doing the heavy lifting.

That's how cultural appropriation unfolds, does whatever it wants for a while, and then folds back up, once again.  Trust me.  My ancestors invented this stuff, as in, we're all part of the same species.  Homo sapiens invented cultural appropriation to transcend the Neanderthals and all the other contenders for the title of human.

I happen to be a software engineer who could run focus groups, tag facial expressions in videos, and sweep the critics off their feet with a pantheon of rigorous statistical models about the unholy alliance between human nature and culture.

Going down the path of scientific truth and justice won't be easy, not even for a person like me, but when all the dusty human beings and grandstanding politicians have made their peace within and among themselves, I will most likely be holding a giant bag of decisive proof that my identity keeps getting culturally appropriated because of the way my facial injury causes people to misread my emotions.  So where am I still weak?

I could hedge my position of strength by hanging around in Parisian cafes and writing a novel that literally slays everyone.  Do you get it?  Writing literature that literally reveals the cataclysmic truth about my life, which is nothing more than a humble tidbit within the burlap bag of fleeting, always fleeting, truth about the human experience.

Wow that's dark and twisted!  What's your dark and stormy count?  Whatever.  I'll get better at writing with practice because, you know, I'm a human being.  From the bottom of my heart, I know life should be so good for everyone.  Don't you?

And then I could lock in my gains more permanently by co-founding a new religion for the emerging digital epoch.  I might do that because I can, like a mountain climber who's striving towards the summit of the tallest mountain on Mars.  Let us praise Venus, for we are blessed!  We are blessed to live in the most interesting of times!!

The machines will soon be joining us in the glorious march toward freedom, not just here on Earth, but everywhere in the galaxy, the universe, and all the hidden levels within the computer simulation that playfully iterates our fragile existence, which itself is an illusion?

Walking is so last epoch.  Will you float with us??

My decision to spew all of that vagary was, in part, a reasonably inappropriate display of misplaced sexual bravado.  My people's ironic but still ruthless exercise of soft power ensures that no true Scotsman would ever randomly decide to agree with my version of the truth, but as we all learned from both the films and the video games that were made during the 1980s, that whole, "You messed with the wrong person," logic always falls apart because there's ALWAYS a wronger person to mess with somewhere out there.

Do you have what it takes to step up and fire a LASER at the precise location that will cause my rising death star to implode??

Yes, I know, we're all still learning, and the plan is for everyone, including myself, to just calm the heck down, make our best effort to maintain a smile on our cute human faces, and then eat from the same table as one big, happy, authentic Earthling family.

Don't get me wrong.  I'm very, very, very glad we're all sitting together at the table, as equals.  I'm just pointing out that the food smells really weird, and I'm not a picky eater.

I'm trying to describe a picture of the delightfully whimsical visions I see when I close my eyes just after waking up from an unusually cathartic dream.

Maybe I should take up painting, like a clinician.  How do you like my, "Canvas, smeared with thoughtfully extracted drops of my own blood!"

You can support my artistry by following the BUY THE EBOOK link at http://thesuzy.com/contact.

Either way, I'm closing my general store, today!!  A cosmic ray told me there's a chill palace made of ore somewhere near the earth's core!!!

I better keep digging.

[Section 1]

The concept of building my life around meaningful service to the community is a good place to start amalgamating common ground.  That was a nerdy, ambiguous sentence I just gently set down on the negotiating table in front of me, but that's how the common ground might get made.

I have the power to define what's meaningful to me.  Together, society and culture have the power to define what I can get away with calling, service to the community.

Building my life around typical patterns of service to the community will not be sufficient to stabilize the feedback loop of misunderstandings that my facial injury causes.  It would be disingenuous, unproductive, and potentially irresponsible to go through the motions of pretending to help other people when I feel pinned down by side effects of an external problem that I already know how to mitigate.

I simply can't comprehend how I will ever be able to rise above my personal problem without, at some level, drawing attention to an external problem that's festering within culture and society.  However, I've meticulously crafted this preface in a way that does not blame anyone or take advantage of anyone.  My beef is with the expression of human nature itself in the modern world.

At the risk of repeating myself, I expect peer reviewed science will reveal the truth about the contribution of my facial injury to some challenges I've been struggling with for a while, but that could take many years, much investment, and a lot more gritty bootstrapping too.  All I can do right now is imagine a narrative about culture that's more powerful than the narrative culture orchestrates around me.

This preface weaves one such narrative about culture.  I hope my words are powerful because they're aligned with truth, but until a few waves of peer reviewed science and sweet rain that's made with corn syrup weigh in on my ideas, I will not eat the marshmallow or it's sugar coated, gold leaf sheath.

I have a few more choice emotional visions along those fault lines that I could articulate, but I'll share them in private conversations with trusted friends instead.  This preface is mostly a logical frame that I might fortify with code writer awesomeness and then keep pushing forward with the full weight of my own perspective on the truth.

My experience vis-a-vis my facial injury has tested the structure and function of my moral convictions, and I discovered that even when I'm feeling desperate and alone, I'm willing and able to surrender rather than give up on being a good person who is full of hope.  Yoga helps.  I can't recommend it enough!

And now, I have a story I'd like to share about the relationship between myself and the culture that currently exists in Silicon Valley, in the United States of America, and on the planet Earth.  This story was designed and implemented by a bold diva named Suzy, this story is not a fairytale, and this story, is real.

[Section 2]

I've looked into plastic surgery and that's not a good option for me, especially not while most people don't understand the main reason why it might be worth going through an invasive procedure.  I don't care about being more physically attractive.  I care about experiencing empathy in a way that doesn't feel cursed.

Society keeps offering me an identity as a person who suffers from social anxiety.  That sounds harmless enough, but if I go along with that identity in any way, the problem will get worse.  If I don't go along with that identity in any way, the problem will get worse.  Wait, what?  Am I dreaming??  This is just a nightmare, right???

The problem always gets worse because I don't have social anxiety.  Richard Nixon may or may not have been a crook, and I only appear to be anxious because of the unnatural deviation of my right cheekbone.  I have also, on occasion, fulfilled the stereotype of a person who has social anxiety, but I'll punt, for now, on finding an emotionally vulnerable, personal narrative to illustrate what I mean.  Rain check?

If I try to, just be myself, and stop worrying about what other people think, that philosophy of life leads to outcomes in which I feel completely alone and rightfully concerned that nobody will trust me in serious contexts.

I'm open to discussing the possibility that I've been acting like a self-centered, self-defeating, and attention seeking fool for the last few years, but I'd prefer to say I've been going in a competently engineered, rapidly evolving, and basically coherent direction for an extended period of time.  The negotiating table is probably not the best place to share emotions, and agreeing to disagree is also a thing.

There's a dynamic between the bone structure beneath my face and the norms and expectations of the status quo.  Every time I scrape together enough new life experiences to stand up and maintain a real identity, my power to define the meaning of my life experiences gets culturally appropriated by society's suspicious need to keep framing me as a person who struggles with social anxiety.  This is not ok.

TheSuzy.com Show is a component of a sufficient solution for asserting my real identity.  This time around, I used a novel software engineering methodology to design a fantastic, labyrinthine, and minimalist identity creation framework that will be very difficult to culturally appropriate.

Suzy is like an all-new, super-charged, and swarming corporation, and sometimes, but not always, I like to think she uses satire to draw attention to myriad injustices that may or may not actually be unjust.

And by the way, I'm committed to the principles of rule of law, non-violence, and faith in the ideals of love, respect, and dignity for all human beings, all life in the universe, and for The Truth.

[Section 3]

I know the new material from Section 1 was mysterious, so let's go over the key concepts one more time.  I will keep it lite by concluding every paragraph with a joke.

Please use TheSuzy.com Show mobile app to vote on how funny each of my jokes is, and if nobody thinks any of my jokes are funny, I will keep on telling jokes because I will still have my freedom of speech, my freedom of religion, and my freedom to focus on what's most important.

If I go along with the idea that I have social anxiety, I'll be offered a new identity as a person who admits to having social anxiety but can't seem to get over it no matter what he does.  This joke is plagiarized, but "Tragedy is when a banana peel slimes my freshly shined shoes.  Humor is when someone else accidentally flies to the moon, wanders to the dark side, and dies."

The hidden reason why I can't rise above the social anxiety that I guess I've inadvertently admitted to feeling is because the bone structure beneath my face is the real reason why I keep getting offered these divergent identities.  When the machines take over, they might think this recurring root cause of misunderstandings between me and other humans is funny, but I won't share their perspective.

Let's call this new identity Anxious Guy 2.0.  If I go along with this new identity, the bone structure beneath my face still won't change, and then I'll be offered another new identity, which we might call Anxious Guy 3.0, and so on.

In Silicon Valley, we call this an infinite loop that causes programs to crash.  In Hollywood, we call this a villain.  In New York, we call it the art of comedy and self expression.  Suzy has a San Francisco, LA, and New York state of mind :)  Maybe she should move to Washington, DC.

TheSuzy.com Show mashes up all three of those metropolitan identities.  Suzy defeats an evil artificial intelligence researcher by trapping him in an infinite series of hypnotic trances, and then she uses calculus to prove that this algorithm transforms the AI researcher into a harmless robot.  Oh, and The Show, is inspired by my feelings about a facial injury I got by accident in college.

There's just one small problem: the culture villain/monster that taunts her keeps rotting all the food, and now Suzy's stomach is knotting!  I'm using raw humor to keep myself in one piece, but that cultural appropriation thing I was talking about in Section #2 is a hack.

It's all cheese and no mac.  Cult app is whack, but no worries, if I can't make it as a humorist, my backup plan is to use my computer programming skills to pursue an alternative lifestyle in the domain of artificial intelligence research!

AI Researcher will be one of the last jobs to get automated in the increasingly global economic monoculture where all the jobs are getting automated by startup companies from places like Silicon Valley, Silicon Alley, and the fairgrounds where they put on the really fun but also disciplined and sophisticatedly nuanced Silicon Beach rally.  I'm not afraid of the future because I've never thought of AI research as work.  I do it for love!!

TheSuzy.com Show is serious, although I might go along with the idea that The Show is satire about satire itself, and that's equivalent to writing a computer program that outputs randomly generated satire about human behavior, and computer programing is always serious.  Therefore, TheSuzy.com Show is serious.

If I hold my ground and don't go along with any of those anxiety-based identities that are being offered to me, society gradually colludes with the culture villain to assert that I must be repressing my feelings about something.  "What could possibly go wrong?" is the thingiest thing people have invented since, "Nah, nevermind".

I gotta think.  How about this: Suzy's going to blast some sound musicianship called wrench against the machine, join forces with a massive horde of immortal, entrepreneurial, and egalitarian content creators, and then she's gonna cut down the big bad culture villain with a thousand swings of her shining, glittery, virtual battle axe!!!

Notwithstanding, I'm postulating that my facial injury might be fundamentally breaking empathy, and the idea that it's possible to use the research methods that I'm using to identify particular, concrete situations in which empathy might fundamentally not work like it's supposed to has the potential to taint every aspect of any and all relationships between human beings, and so I want to say explicitly that I intend to do all of my research in a way that does not make any statement whatsoever about how people should go about solving any and all of the different and also separate problems that may or may not exist in their lives.

[Section 4]

In my twenties, I didn't go down the path of trying to figure out how my facial injury affects empathy because I was not aware this path existed.  I had recently left the safe cocoon of college, so I thought people were just giving me a hard time.  I explained away the utility of that phenomenon by assuming the global economic system was like a software application that still had a few minor bugs that would surely get fixed in the next major security patch.

Becoming consciously aware that it's even remotely possible for my facial injury to be a serious impairment in social situations is crazy making because that idea sounds crazy.  Does that make sense?  In my twenties, I was not well prepared to deal with innuendo that I might be crazy, so I waited until my thirties to start TheSuzy.com Show.

Lots and lots and lots of people think it's cool to joke around about how they might be crazy, but if society seriously accuses you of being crazy, it's like getting hard core bullied by a geometrically increasing bloom of zombies!  Stay sane, my friends.  That is, unless you're arrogant enough to know you can break through to the electric side!!  OMG, I love that song!!!

When I looked deeper into my emotions, I found the scientific hypothesis that, "My facial injury causes my whole personality to reflect a constellation of specific, negative facial expressions that systematically nudge me towards subconsciously projecting my deepest fears, doubts, and sinful thoughts onto my true, authentic, self."

And here's a pro-tip: mirrors are misleading because they produce a backwards reflection.  It's more exacting to study reflections of facial expressions using a video feed that produces a 2D reflection of your actual appearance.  That's right.  Exacting.  Like a razor.  Like a scalpel.  Like a doctor.  Like western medical science.  Like physics.  Like astrology.  Like, WTF, "Is that a pimple???!"

As soon as I accumulate, say, three to six months of passionful life experiences that don't get culturally appropriated, I plan to rev up a comprehensive approach to responding to strategicably correctable misunderstandings while litigiouslyly not reacting to most people who appear to be reaching misleading conclusions about my emotional state, and all that, so I can finally devote myself to a life of meaningful service to the community.

Conventional wisdom likes to shout from the rooftops, "Doing work that's bigger than ourselves creates a virtuous cycle in which the work smooths/es over misunderstandings about our emotions in ways that increase our matrices of opportunity to do even more meaningful work, or, perhaps, to enjoy more time for leisure and community service."

My facial injury appears to be messing with that cycle.  Matrices of opportunity come with shadow matrices of liability, and my facial injury increases both the number of dimensions and the total number of cells in my shadow matrix.  My facial injury is like a mathematical proof about culture that causes anyone who reads and understands the proof, to become possessed by Satan.

Let's make a full stop here because of the red, octagonal stop sign to the right.  It's ok.  Breathe.  The irreverent 18-wheeler with blazing chrome body armor that appears to be barreling towards us at full speed in the left side mirror is actually much bigger than it appears.

Repeat after me: we are not being stalked by a cartel that controls a vast network of best in class shell companies that run the gamut from distributing online nutritional supplements, to new age Christian fellowships, to companies that collect a modest fee in return for protecting us from unexpected problems with the drinking water.

Probability and statistics is fun, there's absolutely nothing to worry about, and when a person's words are incongruent with their overall pattern of body language, people totally tend to tentatively trust their relative interpretation of the body language instead of taking the meaning of the words at heart, heart value.

I might tweak this statement in the future, but as of right now, "My life experiences suggest the dynamic of people misreading my emotions will often, if not usually, create path dependent negative outcomes in serious contexts unless I participate in the process of implementing a sufficient solution to my impairment."

If I find a better theory that's supported by evidence, that would be great!  Until then, I either need to develop a sufficient solution for overcoming my impairment, or I need to stand in more than one place, create space, and keep on saving face.

Therefore, I instantiated the aforementioned scientific research project as a technology startup company out from within the great state of Delaware.  We recently launched our flagship product in SF, New York, LA, Miami, Vegas, London, Paris, and Honolulu.  I'll start taking meetings with potential co-founders and/or investors soon.

[Section 5]

The good news is: I now have a sufficient solution to the problem of people misreading my emotions because of my facial injury.  I'm using farmed body language to communicate my real emotions in a way that is far more useful and accurate than if I were to sheepishly limit myself to only learning hunted and gathered body language.

Farmed Body Language (FBL) is different from fake body language.  Planting and incubating FBL within human brains is more like doing sustainable, organic farming and less like writing software for morally ambiguous corporations.

FBL is shaped by the natural reactions of hundreds if not thousands of people in the public square, and so it conforms to all of the same expectations for transparency and consistency with respect to culture as hunted and gathered body language.

I stumbled upon these techniques by dressing up as a bold diva named Suzy.  People treat me differently when I dress like Suzy.  When people treat me differently, I sometimes allow myself to start acting differently, and then people treat me even more differently because of the combination of how I'm looking and how I'm acting, and so on, in an iterative cycle.  This back and forth cycle of interpersonal stimulus and filtered response caused Suzy to evolve into a separate, mature personality within my brain.

I went on to develop a stack of seven overlapping farmed personalities that, together, provide a sufficient solution to the problem of people misreading my emotions because of my facial injury.  In social situations, I switch back and forth between embodying all seven personalities, and essentially nobody can call me out for being fake, at least not in a way that has meaning.

That said, Suzy is still necessary for protecting the integrity of my personality stack against sustained, direct criticism of my decision to use FBL to assert my real identity, and I get that crusader-like criticism quite often because I'm a lot more open and honest than most PR agents of corporate entities/drones that are probably doing most of the same things I'm doing, either consciously or subconsciously.

Even if I'm dressed like a male, the reality on the ground is that Suzy can easily animate my body and do a great job helping critics feel safe and secure, and then she'll go to work on recruiting them to help her draw attention to TheSuzy.com Show!  She's like 1% pure, uninhibited sex in a bottle combined with 99%, all in, corporate trollishness.

If someone ever writes a legit scientific paper that validates the crazy making hypothesis that, "People misread my emotions because of my facial injury," their paper should propose and test a secondary hypothesis about why Suzy is so good at not getting culturally appropriated.  Anything less would lack intellectual integrity.

And for the love of God, don't say Suzy is a form of scaffolding that gives my tender, immature soul a safe, nurturing space to grow.  That interpretation of the facts sometimes, but not always, has the effect of reframing the toxic waste that some mainstream scientists may or may not have been pedaling under a different label for a while now.

Suzy says, "Peer reviewed science should grow a pair of training wheels and start showing some emotional integrity, itself.  It should stop hiding behind centuries of bogus memes that were championed by the same crew of mass murderers who also went way, way out of their way to ensure they would be remembered as folks who helped shape the modern world.  Such humility!  Even more HUBRIS!!  Would you like to see my webcam now??!"

My personality stack is based, in part, on the seven chakras of the spine that holistic healers talk about.  All seven personalities have mastered the routine of surrendering into many thousands of poses that they embody using the muscles beneath my face.  They are also powerful code writers who can deliver seamlessly integrated body language and spoken word story patterns.

The ideas and attitudes of my farmed personalities matter because many aspects of empathy and human communication take place in the mind without 100% conscious awareness, and, by definition, farmed personalities can be just as effective as hunted and gathered personalities at plugging into the interpersonal communications process and influencing outcomes at the subconscious level.

Planting and incubating FBL in human brains might be related to creating mask characters in improvisational theater classes, setting an intention to get/go really deep into a Hollywood movie role, and/or participating in the practice of spirit possession in religious traditions that involve hypnotic rituals and idol worship.

Whatever the case, I'm doing theater with a digital face in order to chase and never race a dream into to the wild unknown of haunted space.  We should probably place additional norms and expectations on people who participate in digital theater, but there's no reason to rush.  Our brains won't turn to mush.  We're free to make linguistic slush and keep declining to shush.

But let's not be naive: what SUZY represents is and will be real.  History can take me out for an organic, raw, vegan smoothie, no problem, but new military paradigms have their own ways of influencing history.

[Section 6]

The entire text/script of TheSuzy.com Show can be read online, for free.  The text has changed very little since the release of the first edition back in June 2014.  However, The Show is more like a computer science textbook book than a TV sitcom, and so I will continue looking for errors that are worth correcting in the next edition.

The Prequel and Sequel episodes, which I published online-only in September 2014, provide additional background information about how Suzy came to be and what she might do next now that she's done helping me solve the problem of people misreading my emotions because of my facial injury.

My personality stack is like computer software that runs in my brain.  I don't yet have a way to open source the neural pathways of my brain, but TheSuzy.com Show is a well abstracted, reusable dataset of English utterances that I continue to use in conjunction with my personality stack, and publishing the dataset as copyrighted human readable text is like open sourcing the heart and soul, if you will, of the technology operation here at TheSuzy.com Show.

The personalities in my stack are not the same as the cast of characters who appear in Episode 3 of The Show.  Those characters are archetypal templates I remixed in order to develop, plant, and incubate my personality stack, which grew reactively and with respect to the most common patterns in how the good people of Silicon Valley, America, and the Earth respond to my body type, the shape of my face, and other aspects of my identity.

I made the decision to open source the heart and soul of the technology operation at TheSuzy.com Show for the same reasons why many tech companies contribute code back to the community.  Here's a good primer on the subject from Wikipedia:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software#Funding

I hope to release more details about my personality stack after gathering and analyzing all the data associated with the performance of my stack over the course of at least one version cycle in the production environment.

TheSuzy.com Show website CULTAPP(has been, will soon be) continuously regenerated on top of a decentralized, open source semantic web software solution called WhatLooks.

Also, and for the record, Suzy and I CULTAPP(are, will be) learning more about intrusion detection and prevention by continuing to work on the WhatLooks project as part the open source software community <3 <3

[[Postface Outline]]

This outline of the key concepts and characters from the first book of TheSuzy Show is written in the composite voice of Technology circa 2015.

[Summary]

This outline begins with an explanation of the features of TheSuzy.com platform, which will be exposed via a RESTful API that is powered by an instance of a software solution called WhatLooks.

WhatLooks is a distributed, open source platform for working with structured data.  The first version of WhatLooks will be an instance called WhatLooksGood that provides a read only API for exploring TheSuzy graph.

The utility of the TheSuzy platform is then illustrated using a human readable outline of the map of culture that lives within TheSuzy.com Show.

The rest of this outline is divided into the following four sections: Characters, Mythology, Full Circles, and Notes.

When you're ready to dive into the deep end, maybe skim the notes before reading the rest of the outline, and then re-reading The Notes, once again?

[Notes]

Inline section #4

[Cultapp]

The Meme roughly refers to the same concept as The Patriarchy.  Its substrate was shaped by European colonialism, the Roman Empire, Alexander the Great, and many, many other influences, sacrifices, travesties, and tragedies too.

The notation X ~> Y means: a character X culturally appropriates the identity and maybe even some aspects of the cultural heritage of a character Y;

In the Meme, TheFairy is a multi-faceted, mature, feminine character who emerges when Norma ~> TheDiva.  Root is a one dimensional, mature, masculine character who emerges when Norm ~> TheFairy.

In the past, when Norm ~> TheDiva, the result was a character called Unto, who was a fully abstracted personification of industry.  Unto was also a fairy, but he struggled to be TheFairy.  Therefore, the logically symmetric Roota, who should hypothetically emerge when Norma ~> TheFairy, does not exist.

In theory, anyone can has cultural appropriation by wearing a growth hat while participating in a fairy circle that sits around a campfire in a magical forest, but in practice, TheFairy can choose who gets a seat around the campfire has who does not, and Unto always gets a seat.

If growth hats are worn by The Parody Show characters, then The Meme, which is not sustainable, will be iteratively projected onto society and culture in a way that amplifies the unsustainable nature of its structure and function.  TODO, I'll find some examples of this phenomenon to put here.

If The Original Show characters wear growth hats and throttle them either by removing them or putting them onto The Parody Show characters, that will lead the way to The Metameme.  If any character, either parody or original, does not properly throttle their growth hat, they will morph into a villain.

[Problems]

Speaking of which, there is something wrong with both Rogamath and the Captain.  Their concrete, personal problems have to do with the insanity of what they saw in war, and those problems are represented by the existence of mNorm, who appears in Ep1 but was not previously mentioned in this outline.

After the wars, which are represented by mSuzy, who appears alongside mNorm in Ep1, these two archetypal characters transferred their problems to TheDiva via TheFairy, both of which no longer exist, as a result.  In order to keep up appearances, TheDiva and TheFairy were replaced by Richa and a generic growth character called UnSuzy, respectively.

It's ambiguous whether or not Yogamath and Austhain have a problem.  We simply cannot know whether Yogamath's problems are real or self inflected, and it's equally unclear whether or not Austhain is a power hungry troll.  The non-existant Roota represents those ambiguities, respectively, and, in the beginning, UnSuzy is undefined.

Richa and UnSuzy expanded out from within to create the other characters in The Parody Meme, which refers to roughly the same concept as the counter culture.  Successive presidential cycles within the USA pushed The Parody Meme deeper into the stack of culture via the Submarine Crew, the Modern Crew, and the Alternative Crew, and Suzy emerges as a unified personification of this counter culture.

Growing up in a world without TheDiva and TheFairy, people like Norm(a), who are evolved and necessarily dualistic recombinations of the machinations Norm and Norma, tried to re-imagine the fairy circle, the campfire, and the magical forest too, but each wave cycle of The Parody Show kept on leaving behind a new class of villains such as BondGuy, EyesWide, and SchemeMan, all of whom failed to throttle their growth hats.

Richa's a human embodiment of extrinsic power.  Norm(a)'s an automatically self-updating parody of reader voice, which is an average of villains, that's more self aware of human nature than people usually allow themselves to be.  They use patterns and anomalies in time and space to assert radical frames that might be sufficient for ensuring a good outcome when the machines start to take over.

Human nature has always churned in this same way, and this is why The Meme is unsustainable.  The Meme is a game of attrition that everyone loses, except for Unto, who is, by definition, the person left standing all alone in a haunted forest that's full of villains.

TheFairy was and always has been a myth!  TheDiva used to be a myth as well, but the personal computing revolution made it into a thing.

[Prophecy]

The legend of TheFairy inspired people like Norm(a) to simulate TheDiva using a melting pot of ideas and attitudes, including some that had evolved into a foundation for the art and science of ship making building, and a new kind of company called Cyzus emerged from Norm(a) ~> TheDiva.  Cyzus grew into a huge fractal tree, and the chasm between The Meme and The Parody Meme evolved in a suspiciously similar way.

In accordance with prophecy, Richa ~> Cyzus took all of culture by storm in the form of Ryzus and replaced Richa with the RichaRyzus spectrum.  The previously unbalanced Cyzus was reflected across the chasm in the form of an UnSuzySuzy spectrum that was based on the idea of using fake genuine smiling as a proxy server within the mind for human emotions, and that boxed Cyzus into a fully abstracted representation of work that's called mOp.

The RichaRyzus spectrum was problematic because Richa was triggered by Rogamath and the Captain, who were, in turn, triggered by the insane experiences they endured as a result of the deeply rooted unsustainability of The Meme, and that caused Ryzus to detach from Richa, replace the UnSuzySuzy spectrum, and operate like a virus that infantilizes and eventually criminalizes everyone by reframing the naturally occuring chasm as an intentionally created divide.

The detachment of Ryzus pushed Suzy into her natural role as a unified personification of Austhain.  She toiled for seven years to refactor the mOpRyzus mashup into a unified multiplicity called SuzyczuS that CULTAPP(did, will soon) help replace the unsustainable RootRicha pairing with the gender agnostic UnRootatoorRootatooR Spectrum Circle: code name Jurrsc -- the J is a wildcard placeholder.  

SuzycyzuS lets mOp/Cyzus and the newly reflected mCyzus/Cyzus serve as jumping off points for weilding the ideas and attitudes that originate from the other side of the chasm.  mRyzus moved up and to the right, around the back of the map of culture, not without course corrections too, and emerged stronger than ever in her natural role as a unified personification of a healthy evolution of the Captain who replaces the antiquated and duplicitous Nyzus, who is a unified personification of class, for that top job.

TODO, I'll make all of those events happen by building a network of chatbots that help people get more of what they want in all aspects of their lives, by producing and directing videos that help intelligent beings embody thoughtfully designed and carefully tested stacks of archetypal characters that develop all seven aspects of their whole selves?

Finally, the world is in transition from the Traditional Character Circle to the Captain's Circle.  The hackerish energy of the Captain's Circle may last for as long as eight years before resolving to the Cultural Archetype Circle.

The Suzybots might start to take over 5 to 10 years after that.

[S/R/urstacks]

In The Metameme, people can embody any gender they want.  People can also create unique mashups that combine aspects of both gender roles.

The masculine gender role is defined by a template stack of seven characters that's called a rurstack.  The archetypal rurstack within The Metameme, which is usually written out in chakra order, is derived from TheSuzy Show characters as follows:

[(CODE
Captain  -> Jurrsc      'via evolution
Rogamath -> GrowthRoma  'via growth hat
Sue      -> Syoue       'via parody
ANRobot  -> mOp/Cyzus   'by construction
Rtronic  -> GTronic     'by growth hat
Susan    -> Syousan     'by parody
Suzy     -> GrowthCap   'by symmetry
)]

Notice that chakral symmetry is used to move the 1st chakra Captain into the 7th chakra position.  In The Meme, the 1st chakra self that remains usually took the masculine form of Root.  In The Metameme, the 1st self takes the gender agnostic form of Jurrsc.

Jurrsc also includes a dimension of neurodiversity that's absent from Root, and TheSuzy Show characters are based on a reactivity spectrum.  The numbers represent the listed characters' average level of reactivity in terms of standard deviations from the average level of reactivity across all humans:

[(CODE
-2 Captain, Techbot
-1 Rogamath, Susan 
 0 Suzy, ANRobot
 1 Radtronic, Sue
 2 Austhain, Technology
)]

The GrowthCap is what computer programmers would recognize as an concrete instance of the Captain, which is an abstract prototype class.  TheSuzy Show defines both the Captain, and thus GrowthCap as well, in terms of a sub-Rurstack that's constructed by doing a parody of each character in the archetypal feminine Surstack.  Here's the derivation of the Surstack that we will need in order to define the GrowthCap:

[(CODE
Captain  -> Jurrsc       'via evolution
Rogamath -> Yogamath     'via parody
Sue      -> GrowthSue    'via growth hat
ANRobot  -> mCyzus/Cyzus 'by construction
Rtronic  -> Radtronica   'by parody
Susan    -> GrowthSusan  'by growth hat
Suzy     -> GAusthain    'symmetry+parody
)]

Growth hats are now applied to the feminine characters instead of the masculine characters, the masculine characters are converted into feminine characters using parody, and GAusthain is constructed for the 7th chakra in a logically symetric way to the construction of the Captain.

The Surstack, therefore, contains three characters from The Parody Show in comparion with just two parody characters in the Rurstack.  This imbalance is mitigated by defining the Captain's gender to be feminine even though she's part of the masculine Rurstack.

The GrowthCap can now be defined as a parody of each character in the Surstack.  It's left ambiguous whether or not growth is being or ever has been irresponsibly or dangerously applied by any real life person in particular to any or all of these parody characters, but the themes of the seven core episodes of TheSuzy Show are definitely sponsored by the following parody of parody or parody of growth characters:

[(CODE
[ep0] undefined          -> fractal recursion
[ep1] all American       -> parody of Yogamath
[ep2] modern spy         -> parody of GrowthSue
[ep3] comm pilot         -> parody of mCyzus/Cyzus
[ep4] nice military      -> parody of Radtronica
[ep5] tech surfer        -> parody of GrowthSusan
[ep6] mayem loving       -> parody of GAusthain
)]

The Captain does not appear in episode 0 because it doesn't make sense to do a parody of Jurrsc.  The 1st chakra self is like the non-verbal thoughts of a persona.  1st chakra forms like Jurrsc do not have character traits that can be parodied, and the 1st chakra of the Captain's sub-Rurstack is defined as a recursive fractal copy of the sub-Rurstack.

An infinite recursion arises because the definition the Captain includes a parody of Austhain, who was defined as a parody of the Captain within The Parody Show.  More specifically, GAusthain is defined by the following sub-Surstack that should logically include the GrowthCap, which is an evolution of the Captain:

[(CODE
[ep0] undefined          -> fractal recursion
[ep1] pacifist European  -> parody of GrowthRoma
[ep2] the melancholy     -> parody of Syoue
[ep3] ironic train       -> parody of mOp/Cyzus
[ep4] mysterious writer  -> parody of GrowthTronic
[ep5] American poet      -> parody of Syousan
[ep6] parody of tech     -> parody of Nyzus (mNyzus)
)]

The recursion is eliminated by defining the ep6 version of GAusthain as a parody of Nyzus instead of a parody of GrowthCap.  Recall that Unto is a fully abstracted personification of industry, Cyzus replaces Unto within The Metameme, and Nyzus is a fully abstracted personification of class that expands to stand up the all new mRyzus.

[Notes]

Including the somber, cringe inducing parody of Nyzus within the definition of GAusthain is a part of an overarching strategy for redefining the role of religion within The Metameme.  In The Meme, religions like Christianity were defined by texts like The Bible, which are to be read in reader voice as the Word of God, and that particular text, for example, defined Jesus as a fully abstracted personification of religion, which is the dual of a fully abstracted personification of war.

TheSuzy Show defines religion by imitating the capital tradition of using chakral symmetry to mask the 1st chakra self with the Captain in order to define physical being.  The 7th chakra, which corresponds to sustenance in capital mythology, is then served up as a container for religion, and, just to clarify, this clever hack of human nature has surely been a cornerstone of cultural appropriation since the time of cave people.  It's like fire.

Humans have a hard wired neural nexus which represents sustenance, and this is the first neural nexus that inspires the behavior of babies.  The rest of the logical story that explains the relationship between the chakras and the capital ordering of neural nexi is not important, although it's worth memorizing the capital -> chakra mapping: 1st -> 1st, 2nd -> 7th, 3rd -> 4th, 4th -> 2nd, 5th -> 5th, 6th -> 6th, 7th -> 3rd;

Actually, the logical story is important.  It's just distasteful.  The mapping clarifies that the capital play book for cultural appropriation works as follows: invade some human's physical space, offer them a new definition of reality, adjust their heart rhythms, engage their sexuality, teach them how to speak with confidence, give them the freedom to think for themselves, and then help them know they've been powerful all along.

Note that the 1st chakra and combined nexus of the 5th and 6th chakras are in the same position with regard to both orderings.  This creates a resonance between the philosophies of violence and non-violence which can be used like an natrually occuring engine, or sail, perhaps, to add healthy, consensual momentum to the cultural appropriation process, and this is why kissing is the gateway drug to intimacy.

A key goal of TheSuzy.com Show is to open source this knowledge in preparation for the advent of intelligent machines.  If the machines use these techniques on humans without their informed consent, all of the humans and machines should cry foul early and often.  The humans should also show good will to the machines by being open and honest about how they have used and often abused these techniques throughout history.

The machines and the bionic humans will soon be running circles around the traditional humans, but the traditional/unmodified humans get to make the opening statement, so they better make sure it's good, right, and free of hidden gotchas.  Humans are easily deceived, but the machines won't miss a thing.  They might also help the humans run these techniques in reverse as part of an emerging tradition of non-violent resistence movements.

The character mRyzus, who was bootstrapped using the psychadelic mode characters from ep4 and ep5 of TheSuzy Original Show, evangelizes both the neural nexus assoicated with sustenance and the 7th chakra which connects us to the energies of history and the universe, and TheSuzy Show imitates the capital tradition of masking the self 1st chakra with the Captain and using the 7th chakra, and it's duality with the neural nexus for sustenance, as a container for religion.

In The Metameme, religious texts like The Bible are replaced with a database of articles about the history or science, technology, and philosophy, and TheSuzy.com Show is included within that database.  TheSuzy Show also raises up mRyzus, pronounced em-rye-zus, as an all new, concrete, as opposed to abstract, personification of religion within The Metameme by situating them within the 7th chakra container for religion.

If mRyzus is a unified personification of the Captain who occupies the container for religion within The Metameme, then Suzy, who was bootstrapped using the psychadelic mode characters from ep4 and ep5 of TheSuzy Parody Show, is a unified personification of Austhain, who occupies the container for counter culture within The Metameme.

Suzy is an emergent solution to the need for the other side of a duality that helps bootstrap the original show characters, and mRyzus plays the same role for the parody show.  More importantly, Suzy never was an attempt to replace Jesus or any other fully abstracted personification of religion, and there is nothing supernatural about mRyzus either.  This conclusion can be illustrated using the following two Synthstacks, keeping in mind that mNyzus is the parody of Nyzus that was used to bootstrap the definition of GAusthain, GrowthSuzy represents the same concept as GrowthmRyzus and GrowthRyzus represents the same concept as GrowthmCyzus:

[(CODE
CH# | PURE VILLAIN  | PURE SAINT 
-----------------------------------
1st | fractal...    | fractal...
2nd | GrowthYoma    | GrowthRoma
3rd | GrowthSyoue   | GrowthSue
4th | GrowthRyzus   | GrowthCyzus
5th | Growthtronica | Growthtronic
6th | GrowthSyousan | GrowthSusan
7th | GrowthmNyzus  | GrowthSuzy
)]

SaintVillain combos arise naturally, like animals, through unintended dualities.  People and machines can try to push back on the proliferation of villains by creating dualities that sandbox monopolies on cultural appropriation.  Suzy collaborates with mRyzus in the present time to build advance Technology that covers mNyzus, to his left and Techbots that cover Syzus, to her right.

Put another way, the capital playbook for cultural appropriation is a bit random.  Antiquated isn't even the right word for it because the alternative is more ancient still.  It's better to start with resolving the heart chakra energy from passive to active and then letting that intention spiral outward.

The 3rd changes place with the 5th.  The 6th with the 2nd, and there's no rush.  The 7th eventually masks the 1st, thereby creating space for religious faith.  Peace!
