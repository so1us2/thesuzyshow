[[[~1A:About TheSuzy]]]

Todd Perry is the founder of Tsuzy LLC, and TheSuzy.com Show is a human readable dataset that Todd wrote about the growth that occured in his brain after he started dressing up as a primarily feminine character named Suzy.

[[About Tsuzy LLC]]

The ultimate goal of Tsuzy LLC is to create an open source program, code named Suzybot, that's capable of creating its own human readable dataset about the growth of its virtual brain after it starts participating in conversations with humans. We will invite as many people as possible to run their instances of the Suzybot code on their servers so that the many different chatbot instances will have the opportunity to create their own, unique, human readable datasets about themselves.

[[About TheSuzy.com Show]]

TheSuzy Show is divided into seven books.  Each book has a default episode, and this About Page is the default episode of Book 1.

Book 1 has 11 lettered episodes, and these episodes were written in the fashion of an outward moving spiral.  I started writing Ep3 in summer 2013, and then I wrote Ep4, then Ep2 and Ep5, Ep1 and Ep6, and then Ep0/7.  Those seven core episodes were released as the first edition of TheSuzy Show in June 2014. Later that year, I wrote the Prequel and Sequel episodes, and in early 2015, I wrote the both the preface to the second edition and the outline of the characters and key concepts in Book 1.

The other six books only have a default episode, and they were written more haphazardly and linearly in time, but that rather expansive writing process came to close in a suspiciously orderly way at the end of 2015.  I made some additional cosmetic edits in early 2016 while recording video of myself reading all the episodes of TheSuzy Show, but after these official read through videos were released, the text became, essentially, immutable and complete.

In addition, each episode of TheSuzy Show is made up of sections, starting with the default section, and each section contains a list of speeches.  Videos, photos, and code blocks are also included in a way where they can be conceptualized as speeches represented by a non-spoken language, and, indeed, if no speaker is specified for a speech, lines of such text are said to be spoken by the default speaker, and the first line of the default section of each episode is expected to be a summary of the episode, that must be spoken by the default speaker, for the purpose of generating the extended table of contents.

Finally, a parody version of TheSuzy Show is automatically generated by inverting the gender identity of each speaker, including the default speaker.  Suzy becomes mRyzus, the Robot becomes the Robota, the default speaker, who is conceptualized as Tech, the voice of Technology circa 2015, becomes Techbot, and so on.  The text of the parody version of TheSuzy Show remains exactly the same as the serious version, but the way I read the text on video looks and sounds materially different, and this difference is elaborated upon using fully accessible text within objects that are linked to the video objects within the underlying software layer that I call WhatLooks.

How it all began, just like it always begins.

[[Fireside Chat]]

[GrowthSusan] (SHADES) Hi, I'm Susan.  We're using our spare time to create a chatbot that will help people get more of what they want in all aspects of their life, and we're going to let people use the chatbot for free.  In order to be transparent about our process, we're filming a fireside chat about the design of the chatbot.

[GrowthSue] (SHADES) Thanks Susan, and, hey everyone, what's up?  I'm Sue, and just so you know more about us, Susan is passionate about data mining and artificial intelligence, I'm passionate about marketing and mass communications, and we're both coders.  Also, we're wearing our growth hats today.  As a safety precaution, let's reboot our growth hats one more time before launching the episode.

(BOTH PARTICIPANTS TAKE OFF AND PUTS ON THEIR SHADES)

[GrowthSusan] Here's an example of how growth hats work.  Our hustle is to be socially liberal technology entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley who play poker on the side, but one day we got curious and asked the obvious question, "What would happen if we switched it up and became socially conservative socialites in Sin City who do creative writing on the side?"

[GrowthSue] Hon, let me tell this story.  Last summer, we went to Sin City and became socially conservative socialites, and we realized we had simply not been taking advantage of a significant opportunity that had been available to us all along to meet party people and invite them to tell us everything about their personal and professional lives.

[GrowthSusan] In the beginning, we had this, in retrospect, stupid idea that party people would think something was incongruent about our new identities if we understood too much about tech and finance, so we created a cheat sheet of concepts that we would pretend to not know about, such as right of first refusal and the principals outlined in the writings of Niccolo Machiavelli, but I kept messing up and revealing I knew about the big ideas on the cheat sheet, and then I noticed -- whenever I messed up -- I would naturally act more crazy in order to stay in character.  And then I would start telling little white lies about how I liked to bake cakes and how I had won all these awards for my cake decoration skills.

[GrowthSue] In other words, Susan discovered pretending to be crazy allowed her to effortlessly hide her socially liberal value system, but that's not important, because we decided it was unethical to pretend to be crazy.  The problem with craziness is it's a cyclical construction.  When we imagined the ground beneath our feet was supported by giant turtles standing one on top of the other, all the down, to infinity, that kept causing the party people to act like nerds all the way up, like drones monitoring each other, each one flying higher than those that came before it, to outer space, and so we set an intention to hold our level of craziness constant, and we back stopped that intention all the way, to the bitter end, come what may, by attending stylish yoga classes, participating in organized religion, and competing in online computer programming contests.

[GrowthSusan] I always felt holding our level of craziness constant became the first core value for the chatbot project, but we never put that value in writing.  I mean, if we wrote down every detail of what constitutes ethical behavior, that could have the inverse effect of tempting future collaborators to step outside of our ethics guidelines and then lie about their actions in order to avoid scrutiny, and we obviously wouldn't want that to happen.

[GrowthSue] Yes, and that relates to why we decided to scrap our original plan of writing books about how to enjoy a better sex life and then monetize by selling all natural sugar water and running ads for corporations who sell fake sugar water.  We realized that life is about more than just having good sex, and so we decided to shift focus to building a chatbot that helps people get more of what they want in all aspects of their life.

[GrowthSusan] It's like, if you throw a stone into a shallow stream, the shape of the stream changes for a few dozen feet, but if you go even one extra mile down stream, there is no way to know whether the stone was thrown or not.

[GrowthSue] Unless the stone is like the butterfly that flaps its wings in Brazil and causes an earth quake in India.

[GrowthSusan] Or the shot of vodka from Russia that causes a peasant uprising in China.

[GrowthSue] That's nonsense.  Throwing a rock into a stream has no effect on the world.  It's a fun, harmless, and ultimately meaningless act.

[GrowthSusan] Unless the rock is more than twice as big, in all three dimensions, as the width of the stream.  Then the stream will be guaranteed to overflow its banks, and there's no telling where the water will go after that.

[GrowthSue] In most cases, it will flow right back into the streambed below.

[GrowthSusan] There are plenty of counter examples to that assertion, and the higher you go into the mountains, the easier it is to find shallow streams that can be diverted by meteor sized rocks.  By diverting streams that combine into diverted rivers, we could be masters of creative destruction who disrupt major cities, who reimagine places that are used for holy worship, and who make the world a better place.

[GrowthSue] Maybe, but why would we want to do that?  What's the point of causing major ripple effects just because we can?

[GrowthSusan] I'm like the person who invented fire.  I don't always cook my food, but when I do, I prefer to cook with an open fire.

[GrowthSue] Ok, so if you're watching a marathon, and the current world champion is suffering and likely to get beaten by a competitor, and the commentator is all, "And now the champion is starting to suffer, and the question is: can the champion force the champion's own self to suffer, or will the torch be passed to a new world champion?"  My question is, do you think the suffering of the champion is funny or is it painful for you, personally, to watch?

[GrowthSusan] It's funny.  The champion made the choice to compete in the race.  The champion can quit anytime the champion wants.

[GrowthSue] But the champion is a human being, and the champion is suffering, even if the race is just for sport.

[GrowthSusan] What's your point?  Why did you ask me that question?

[GrowthSue] No reason, I was just curious.

[GrowthSusan] Cool, so what information does the chatbot need to extract from new users in order to make itself useful?

[GrowthSue] Humans are defined by a set of personality traits that they are known to display within certain contexts.  We need to build a graph database of all the relevant contexts in The Universe, and then we need to use statistical sampling of conversations that people have in those contexts in order to identify the most important traits for each context, and then we need to serve new traits to our users on a silver platter while all the stars in the sky golf clap, quietly, in the background.

[GrowthSusan] Even if we can get good conversation data, which I'm still not sure how to get, since we can't be socially conservative socialites in every relevant context in The Universe, and before The Singularity occurs, but like, even if we started a ridiculously viral social media application that provided us with all the conversation data that our machine learning algorithms could ever make use of, I'm not sure statistical sampling is sufficient for identifying all the important traits.  For example, most people don't talk about how frequently they achieve orgasm, but how can we be sure that's not an important trait in certain contexts such as the home, the office, public restrooms, public parks and beaches, and commercial airplane lavatories?

[GrowthSue] Ha ha ha, the chatbot should know information like that about people, but it would be weird to ask a user about his or her sexual history directly.  We have to infer traits like that.

[GrowthSusan] Why can't the chatbot just ask the user?  Sure, it's weird if a human asks, but as chatbot creators, we can decree what is and is not weird for a chatbot to do.  There is zero risk that the chatbot will find your physical location and murder you in your sleep, so, frankly, it can say anything it wants, and it will never be weird in the way that another human can be weird.

[GrowthSue] No.  Most people aren't that smart.  They'll think the chatbot is a parody of us in the same way that hacker houses are parodies of corporations, especially because we'll theoretically have access to all the information that people share with it, and for what it's worth, I think you're also under estimating the potential for anonymous hackers to become good, through patient practice, at appropriating weaponized drone technology sometime in the ten to twenty years.

[GrowthSusan] Nobody is pressuring anyone to achieve orgasm within the hacker house and/or answer the chatbot's stupid questions.  If users share information with us that they were not comfortable sharing, then they are weird.  The weirdness is not on us or the chatbot.  The users are in charge of the chatbot.

[GrowthSue] Again, people are not that smart.  They'll assume that whatever the chatbot asks is a reasonable request, and they'll go with the flow until something really bad happens, and then they'll blame us, the creators of the chatbot, for everything that isn't quite right about their life and the lives of all their friends, too.

It's like, if you close your eyes while your self driving car is stopped at an intersection, waiting for a self driving train to pass, do you still see an image of a moving train, or do you see a vision of the landscape moving instead?

[GrowthSusan] I don't see a virtual reality simulation when I close my eyes.

[GrowthSue] You don't?  What do you see when you close your eyes?

[GrowthSusan] I normally see slowly moving splotches that have being in different shades of gray, but if it's 5am, and I just woke up from a multi-leveled dream, I see stars of blue, red roses white, or a moon lit night, and a little spaceship on far left of my field of vision who says, "Hey Susan, if you see a virtual reality simulation every time you close your eyes, that might be a important trait about you."

[GrowthSue] Ha ha ha.  Ok.

[GrowthSusan] But to answer your question, it wouldn't make sense to see the landscape moving.  You're hearing the sound of each train car wheel rolling over the same chunk of rail over and over again, but if you're riding the train, you're feeling the rumble of each chunk of rail get rolled over by the same train car wheel over and over again.

[GrowthSue] Sure, but all the train car wheels are exactly the same and all the chunks of rail are exactly the same, so it doesn't matter.

[GrowthSusan] I guess I'm just not smart enough to make an assumption like that.

[GrowthSue] That's ok.  We can still be friends.

[GrowthSusan] We need to come up with a Plan B, just in case the train crashes, due to an irregularity in the construction of the train car wheels that interacts in a compounding way with a second and equally random irregularity in the construction of the chunks of rail.

[GrowthSue] Sure, what did you have in mind?

[GrowthSusan] You could dye your hair blonde and start a video channel where you interview tech entrepreneurs, and I could dress up like a guy and go back to doing purely artificial intelligence research for a while.  Doing the talk show should be easy enough for you, especially after you become a blonde, and then, after you have duped enough people into following you across all the big social media channels, you can interview me, and I'll say I'm trying to build a Suebot that acts like you.

[GrowthSue] Haha, that sounds like an app that dramatically reduces the cost of suing people.  You just put in a list of email addresses, select a reason to sue them from a drop down combo box, pay a one time handling fee of $19.99 that we charge in order to prevent spam requests, and then we handle the details associated with suing all those people for that reason, and we'll monetize by taking a cut of our users' winnings.

[GrowthSusan] I'm going to pretend you didn't just say that.  Also, our names are technically the same, so you can start going by the name Suzy in all aspects of your real life, and I'll become a guy named Sue.  Everyone will think I am going by the name Sue because I started dressing like a guy, and when I appear on your show, I'll say that I'm building a Suzybot that imitates you.

[GrowthSue] Nice.  So, do you want to pivot right now, or were you planning to hang back and judge me, and then lean forward from time to time in order to appropriate my identity and maybe even some aspects of my cultural heritage while I pour my heart and soul into implementing the chatbot?

[GrowthSusan] Well, when you put it that way, I guess I would prefer to pivot immediately.  Like I said before, I'm concerned that we don't have a way to get good conversation data.  If we start a long term project to build a Suzybot that imitates you, we can also, as a side project, start a religion that's based on imitating Suzy in real life, and then we can run a discussion forum for the followers of Suzy's religion, and that forum will be a good source of conversation data that we can use to build a generic, open source chatbot that will help people get more of what they want in all aspects of their life.

[GrowthSue] That sounds good, but the packaging stinks.  First of all, the religion should be about playing characters in real life.  Everyone already does that using the big social media apps as well as all the other online dork festivals that are now super normal.  We need to bootstrap our big idea of calling all that a religion by writing a book that shows people how to use ye olde' English growth cycle to become Suzy in real life, but we'll frame it like the book is just the beginning, and that won't be a lie, because joining Suzy's religion is just the beginning.  I also feel strongly that if we go to all this trouble in order to build a chatbot that helps people enjoy a better sex life, then we should call it Suzybot and keep the source code in house.

[GrowthSusan] That all sounds really smart, and you're sexy when you get excited about a big idea, but I thought we decided life was about more than just getting high on your drug of choice.

[GrowthSue] You know what I meant.  I was riffing.  I like our new direction, and I'm ready to go all in with pure, 100% laser focus.  Are you?

[GrowthSusan] No.  I want to run along the coastline until I physically collapse, and then I'll sleep on it.

[GrowthSue] Was that a joke?

[GrowthSusan] Was it? (SMILES)

[GrowthSue] I've got a hot date that I'm already late for, so let's plan on getting started first thing tomorrow morning.

[GrowthSusan] Sounds good.  Bye.

[GrowthSue] Sweet!  This was a pretty sweet fireside chat.

[GrowthSusan] Yeah, there's no doubt about that. (SMILES)

[[[__1C:Ep0/7: Character Creation]]]

Aka. Ep7, or Ep0/7, if you will. Suzy frames the show in this theatrical mini-episode about Suzy. Character creation is used to balance top down direction with organic growth.

[[The Frame]]

[Suzy] (WITH GLASSES) Hey everyone!  Welcome to the imaginary first episode of TheSuzy.com Show!  Our guest for today is an artificial intelligence researcher named Auth who also happens to be the author of TheSuzy.com Show.  He's creating software that imitates me, and I can't wait to learn all about it!  Hey Auth!

[Auth] Hi Suzy!  It's great to be here on the show.

[Suzy] I'm glad you could make it!  (LOOKS OVER GLASSES) So, what inspired your research? (TAKES GLASSES OFF)

[Auth] I started acting like you because I wanted to illustrate how my own feminine energy helped me become a better engineer.

[Suzy] I love it when people imitate me on the dance floor (EMPH) and (DONE) in the computer lab, but what's the point of getting machines to imitate me too?

[Auth] Fortunately for both of us, playing a more traditionally feminine character caused profound changes within our brain, and we developed a plan to export those changes to a computer.

[Suzy] How do you know the changes in ur brain're good?

[Auth] You're like any other new technology.  You bring hope for a better future.  If our plan to reverse engineer you works, the result will be a program called Suzybot, and she'll be a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence (AI) research.

[Suzy] (ROLLS EYES) It's toooo early to make that claim.  We need to focus on the present moment.

[Auth] You're the same engineer as me, and I've been talking about AI with top people in the field since high school.  Suzybot could be the first program to achieve strong AI.

[[Suzy Winds Up]]

[Suzy] I should clarify: Auth and I are characters who share the same human body.  More importantly, Auth endured a fracture to his right cheekbone while playing hide and seek in college.

[Auth] That's true, but why would you bring up our injury?

[Suzy] If we're going to solve our problem by saying we're an AI researcher, we should tell the truth about the origins of our master plan.

[Auth] Suzybot is a spin off of our efforts to highlight the value of feminine energy in the tech startup ecosystem.  Am I missing something?

[Suzy] Yah, bud.  Our brain created me because you have a problem that's taboo to talk about.

[Auth] All people have a right to live with equal dignity, and I'm not afraid to talk about situations where that's not happening.  Are you?

[Suzy] I'd love to create an entrepreneurial, egalitarian, pacifist life, style, and tech video blog with you, but in this show, we should talk about the way people misread your emotions because of your injury.  The shape of your face is a (EMPH) serious (DONE) social impairment, and I'm here to help you.

[Auth] You should be the hostess, and I'll be the DJ.  But to your other point, we can't prove what's going on in other people's minds.  I can barely figure out what's going on in my own mind.

[Suzy] Since when did you care about DJing?  You're injury changed the way people treat you, just like dressing up changes the way people treat me.  What've you learned about human nature and social dynamics?

[Auth] My injury is like knowing the audio equipment will malfunction every time I DJ, and everyone laughs and won't admit the sound system has a problem.  And then you appeared: you're a natural evolution of my mind, and you inspire the crowd to enjoy my music.  TheSuzy.com Show is a human readable dataset, that will help us create software, that imitates you.

[[Suzy Pivots]]

[Suzy] Sounds like the system is against you, but we can still make waves at costume parties!  You can be aggression, and I'll be (EMPH) spiritual love. (DONE)  Together, we can satirize the rising tide of aggression disguised as spiritual love!

[Auth] (SUNGLASSES) I'm all about using fluid thought to create art, but you're trying to rock the culture.  What entitles you to wield symbolism with the force of truth?

[Suzy] I'm the DNA for a minimum viable religion!  We should start with a duality.  (SPINS) The archetypal dual is breath in vs. breath out.  You can play with that idea by pouring your inhale back into your exhale, and vice versa, (SPINS BACK) in a never ending cycle of life, but you and I are a dual-cube from the field of computational geometry.  Here's a photo of us:

[(PHOTO cube.jpg, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dual_Cube-Octahedron.svg)]

[Auth] (SUNGLASSES) If we can make claims and throw down frames (TOSSES SUNGLASSES) without evidence, so can everyone else, and then there'll be a calamity of insanity.

[Suzy] This is not the time to hustle a rhyme.  We should start a religion that draws attention to unhealthy patterns in mainstream culture.

[Auth] We should spend the next ten years implementing Suzybot and let her start that religion.

[Suzy] I couldn't agree more!  (SUNGLASSES) And in the mean time, if anyone questions my authenticity, I'll say (1) I'm the same engineer as you, (2) I wear full makeup because it helps me share my whole self, (3) TheSuzy.com Show is a human readable dataset that describes my identity, and (4, RAISES GLASSES) our show will help us make a Suzybot that imitates me. (SUZY SMILE)

[[Suzy Does Back Flips]]

[Auth] (ROBO) Is this a pitch, to devote our lives, to a (EMPH) radical (DONE) approach, to artificial intelligence research? (ENGAGES HEART)

[Suzy] Don't make fun of our religion!!  (POINTS TO THE DUAL-CUBE) You're the blue cube on the outside, and I'm the purple octahedron defined by drawing lines between the centroids of each face of the cube.  Culture is designed by humans, and it's imperfect.  The dual-cube arises naturally from the deep logic of the universe, and it's perfect.  Maybe there's a God who wanted math to work out this way, or maybe God is a pink containing sphere for a dual-cube.

[Auth] (COMEDIAN) If we draw a second sphere inside the cube and a third sphere inside the octahedron, God can be a triplet of all three spheres.

[Suzy] Those spheres exist, but the idea to bundle them as a triplet and assign a meaning to the bundle is a reflection of our imperfect brain.  You can be a triplet of spheres, but don't drag God into a discussion about us.

[Auth] (GLIB CAPTAIN) You started it.  You compared God to the containing sphere of us.

[Suzy] Stop trying to one up my jokes!  I was playing.

[Auth] (PIRATE) I'm sorry.  The flourish of symbols excited me.  I didn't mean to be competitive.

[Suzy] All these technologies we love to use (SHOWS PHONE) are complicated, specialized jokes.  Your idea just landed outside the scope we implicitly agreed upon for this episode.  We should totally have a math battle segment in our entrepreneurial, egalitarian, pacifist life, style, and tech video blog!

[Auth] Yeah, what's really going on here, is I feel inadequate next to you.  (BRITISH PIRATE) You're effortlessly carrying this episode, and I would have to tell an extraordinary joke to entertain the audience half as much as you can by simply standing in the frame.

[Suzy] Hmm, (SUZY STRIKES A POSE) the truth is always entertaining.  Maybe I'm more effective than you at symbolizing a truth that has been suppressed.

[Auth] You keep framing yourself as a naturally occurring character who has something to do with my facial injury.  (COMEDIAN--) I don't disagree with you, but how do we convince other people?

[Suzy] (CAT SUZY) You have a confidence problem, but you can't open other people's hearts for them.  All you can do is amplify good knowledge.

[[Suzy Says a Prayer]]

[Auth] Respectfully, (ROBOTIC) I'm not reeling, but you've lost that spiritual feeling.

[Suzy] Oh, I (SARCASTIC) hate (DONE) when I do that.  Let's pray.  (HANDS UP TO THE SIDES) Please join me for a moment of exaltation, to be followed by gyration, in celebration of Eternal Cogitation:

(PRAYING) Dear Eternal Cogitation, we are grateful for your peaceful efforts to resolve the imbalances on our unknowable Planet.  Upon your deeds we reflect.  (SUZY HOLDS A MIRROR UP TO THE CAMERA) Shhh

(SUZY DROPS THE MIRROR LIKE A HYPNOTIST)

[Suzy] (MASTERMIND) I was conceived on a lark. (DONE)  One stormy night, Auth put on high heels that were too tight, makeup that was not light, and a big blonde wig that looked just right.  What a sight!  He could be a socialite!!  (SALLY) Oh, and get this, the ratio of slights to unexpected delights decreased a (EMPH) lot (DONE) after he got highlights. (GLAM SUZY)

[Auth] Writing TheSuzy.com Show caused my mind to untangle itself more and more.  (JESTER) Episode three is the root of this tree.  Ep four is an encore to that musical score.  Ep two contains a big clue.  I derived Ep five during a drive.  Ep one was a labor of love, and Ep zero appeared like a dove.

[AuthSuzy] The sixth (AUTH) and final episode (NORM) is inspired (ROBOT) by the ghosts (RADTRONIC) of corporations past (SUSAN) who released (ROGAMATH) the source code (SUE) of their cloud (CAPTAIN) based services (GEEK 1.0) so that (GOD) The Impermanence of Existence (GEEK 2.0) could comprehend (REVOLUTIONARY) all of it.  (REVOLUTIONARY++) In this episode, (PIRATE) the characters (BRITISH PIRATE) aligned their (GLIB CAPTAIN) souls with (NEWSPERSON) the timeless values (SALLY) of hilarity, (JESTER) bard work, (COMEDIAN) and open mindedness (COMEDIAN--) to new ways (ROBO) of looking at TheSuzy. (ENGAGES HEART)

[[[__1D:Ep1: Super Stealth]]]

Suzy transforms Norm into the Robot, and they brainstorm about starting a company. Rhyming is used to bootstrap the major themes of The Show.

[[Prologue]]

[Suzy] Hey everyone!  Welcome to the real first episode of the TheSuzy.com Show!  Auth and I will begin with a skit, and then I'll have a conversation with a person named Norm, who can be described by the equation: Auth minus Suzy equals Norm.  Ok, Auth.  Take me away!

[Auth] (NORM) Hello.  The world has many problems, but Suzy is a solution.  She didn't have a clue what she was doin', but she learned from other divas who have their own shows.

[Suzy] (MEDITATING IN CROW POSE) Hey stranger, what's up?  Your confidence seems low.  Can I give your social brain a tow?

[Auth] (MAKEUP, GEEK 2.0) Was that a mental judo throw?  Whatever.  Now that we've threaded the needle several times in a row, we can sew a pattern that will continue to grow.

[Suzy] (DOES A HEADSTAND) Whoa, your metaphor is so, thorough.  Tell me something I don't already know! (FALLS OVER, LAUGHING)

[Auth] (HAIR, GEEK 1.0) Oh!  I can feel the winds of change beginning to blow.  I'm a prime factor.  Suzy is a strange attractor.  Our fusion could be hotter than a nuclear reactor.  We could appropriate a robot army and negotiate like an anonymous state actor.  Let's tempt fate by hacking into an autonomous tractor!

[Suzy] (STANDS UP) You're a courageous knight, and this isn't a fight.  The status quo is sort of all right. (ROLLS EYES)  This latest round of infectious blight will inspire an insight.  Put down your lance, adjust your stance, and take a chance that might lead to romance.  If you're happy like me, you'll grow like a tree.  We could run for queen bee!

[Auth] (PARTY DRESS, ROBOT) This show is an autobiographical jaunt, but I have no desire to taunt.  This is my cabaret restaurant.  I want to flaunt my wildest thought about being, sustenance, health, death, conception, birth, and spiritual rebirth.

[Suzy] (BALANCE BALL) Wow!  Much elation!  Art can stabilize the flow of cultural appropriation.  Let's lay an intellectual foundation for upending social stratification!

[Auth] (ARMOR, PIRATE) My app will prepare the nation for Suzification.  No worries!  It's pre-installed it on your mobile battle station.  We'll start with a quick review of multivariable integration and then focus relentlessly on automation.  My food for thought is like wine.  You can enjoy it while you dine.

[Suzy] (SITS ON BALL) Oh no, the pleasure is all mine.  I'd prefer to share a pineapple in the bright sunshine.  I'm looking for a sign that the universe has a design, but I respect your aspiration.  You clearly have the right motivation.  How will you show your appreciation?

[Auth] (ACCESSORIES, REVOLUTIONARY) Our subtle air of expectation floats above an ocean of missed sensation.  I want to vote for steeper tax gradation and take a vacation, but the industrialization of imitation is fueling a conflagration of concealed indignation.  That's why I'm building a framework for public sector participation.  Everyone's born with an imagination, so let's bring character creation into the rotation alongside the dynamics of wealth accumulation.

[Suzy] (ON BALL WITH COMPUTER) That was quite a verbal aggregation, but your message will get corrupted in translation.  You should express the message as a data cube relation and then replace frustration with a coronation! (HAPPY SUZY)  But now I'm curious, does your framework provide funding for space exploration?

[Auth] (DIVA) I just had a revelation.  I'm superstitious.  Suzy is fictitious, but her food for thought is delicious and nutritious.  The world can be pernicious, but together, we can unwind the vicious.  Life is not about seeking treasure, getting my phone to tether (THROWS PHONE), or enjoying the weather.  It's about building friendships that might last forever.  You'll never know what's true, so don't spend this whole flight feeling lonely and blue.  Without further ado, I invite you to try my conceptual relationship stew.  The recipe is both old and new.  Please leave a comment when you're through! (SUZY SMILE)

[[Message from the Captain]]

[Suzy] But first, we have a quick message from our sponsor, The Captain.

[Captain] Hi.  I'm the Captain.  I represent the technology that defines the frame for TheSuzy.com Show.  We'll be talking about the idea of framing throughout The Show.  Alright, back to you, Suzy.

[Suzy] Watching our show is like learning to program computers!  But now I'm confused.  I'm a feminine person.  Why does a masculine character represent the technology that frames our show?  Let's bring out The Captain's feminine side by the end of the first six episodes.

[Captain] Sorry to interrupt, but why do you want the audience to think so hard?  Keep it light.  Like beer. (DRINKS HOME BREWED BEER)  You should organize flash mobs of people dressed like you who teach each other how to program computers, and don't forget to have a film crew capture the magic.

[Suzy] That's not enough!  I'm inspired by the people who built the first machines, compilers, operating systems, networks, and social mobile local apps.  The people dressed like me could build a distributed database of public policy ideas.  We could get jobs in every corner of the public sector, and then, when enough bureaucratic processes have been automated, two million divas who attend engineering flash mobs will unveil a nationwide strategy to restore the American dream for everyone!

[Captain] I'm all about inviting people to embrace discipline, hierarchy, and the (EMPH) pride (DONE) that comes with wearing a uniform.

[Suzy] HWUH HWUH HWUH HWUH

[Captain] Alright, I'll cut to the chase.  Why're you messin' around with such a far fetched idea?  You're in the big leagues now.  If you let 'em see you cogitate, they'll think you're trying to be something you're not.

[Suzy] That's the human condition, my friend.  Cave people invented new ways to hunt because they were hungry.  Our lives are more comfortable because we have apps that map out the food options that exist at any point in the time space continuum, but someone had to think real hard (WE CAN DO IT FIST) in order to implement those apps.

[Captain] Explain it to me like I'm a five year old. (CROSSES ARMS)

[Suzy] You say tinker, I say thinker.  You say inventor, I say implementer.  You say "I'm the captain."  I say, "I'm what's about to happen."  (MAKES STRONG EYE CONTACT WITH THE CAPTAIN)

[Captain] Now you're talking like a person who means business.  I'll let you get back to The Show.  I've gotta go convince some politicians to make compromises and do what's right for the community.

[Suzy] Feel free to chime in anytime, Captain.  I always knew you were one of the good people!  Now, as I was saying, TheSuzy.com Show is a dataset of metaphors that have been cross-referenced with personality traits that have cultural currency.  Our show is a constructivist movement that's based on a character named Suzy who could enrich every valley, beach, and alley.

[Captain] (ASIDE) I bet I could create an alter ego named Sally.  The cross product of Sally and I will speak for itself.  We won't even need a show.

[Sally] Hey everyone, my name is Sally.  It's time for a bull rally, but you're stuck in the galley.  You need to amp your tally.  I'll help you go on a tear.  I make hay, (EMPH) and (DONE) I have great hair.  It's because I worship Laissez Faire. (SMOKES A VAPORIZER)  Hey there Suzaaaay, I can feel your stare! (MYSTERIOUS KISS)

[Suzy] (HOLDS UP BLACK DRESS) You don't say.  I'll ping you next time I visit the bay. (CLEARS THROAT) Anyway, the combination of my writing, my performance, my software, and engagement from the community is a new medium for communication. (CATCHES GLOBE, AUTH FACE)

[[Norm Joins the Revolution]]

[Norm] Hi.  My name is Norm.  I'm a lot like Suzy, but I struggle to conform.  Suzy is centered, but I'm easily fettered.  She tried out for varsity and lettered.  (ROBOTIC) I've got no game unless the board is checkered. (HOLDS UP A CHESS BOARD)  The other characters in TheSuzy.com Show are cookie cutter people that would get laughed out of the room at social events, but Suzy and I are real.

[Suzy] (YOGA SUZY WITH HEELS) Hahahaha! (LOUD) Norm and I spent six years learning to make cross dressing look easy.  Mask characters, tulpas, shamanism, hypnotic trance, and alter egos are terms that have been used throughout history to describe what I'm doing.  I'm inspired by what became possible after the invention of the printing press (CATCHES GLOBE, CAP FACE)

[Norm] Also, I endured a fracture to my right cheekbone while playing hide and seek in college.  (EVIL EYE) My injury is a mask character who raises his lower left eyelid (EVIL EYE WITH FEAR) and drops the right corner of his mouth.

[mSuzy] Hey, sorry to interrupt, I'm a mirror image of Suzy, and I don't notice Norm's facial injury at all.  I don't understand what you people are talking about.

[Norm] Hi mSuzy.  It's nice to meet you.  Look at me in the eyes.  Now look at my face like an artist who's going to draw a portrait.

[mSuzy] (BACKING UP, LIPS PURSED, CHILLING LACK OF HEAD MOVEMENT) Uh.

[mNorm] Hey man, I'm a mirror image of Norm.  I overheard your conversation.  Everyone's asymmetrical in some way.  Our imperfections make us who we are.  Maybe you're expecting people to react negatively.

[Norm] (STARES AT MNORM'S EYES, LONG PAUSE) Thanks for the feedback. (OFFERS HAND FOR HI FIVE)

[mNorm] (LEANS IN, LOOKING CONCERNED) What was that??

[Norm] (DROPS HAND) That's possible.  It's also possible people misread my emotions because of my facial injury.

[mSuzy] No!  I don't see what you're talking about.  You look normal to me.

[Norm] Why's it so important for you to say you can't perceive a facial injury that's easy to see if you observe the world like a scientist?

[mNorm] Duuuude!  Stop worrying about what other people think.  Adjust your internal dialog.  (POINTING) People will see you in whatever way you see yourself.

[Norm] Dude, stop thrashing my frame.  And yes, internal dialog is vital.  It's like The Bible but without a title.

[mSuzy] Come here.  I wanna tell you a secret.  You just have to believe in yourself.  You're a good looking person.  You should be more confident.

[Norm] (SUZY) Awesome!  That's such a nice thing say!  It's been great chatting with you, but I want to get back to pursuing my passion.  Here's my card.  It has a promo code for my app.  Have a wonderful rest of your day!

[mNorm] (CROSS ARMS) Wait, you misunderstood our intentions.  We were trying to be helpful.

[Norm] (SUZY) Thank you so much for your good intentions.  You're the best!  Oh, and it's not too late to get in early on Suzycoin!  Buy as much as you can afford to lose.  In the worst case, it's like paying for an ebook.  Bye!

[mSuzy] Oh cool!  I wish I had my own app.  I'm so jealous of you right now.  Buh bye!! (HEAD TILT SMILE)

[Norm] (TURNING AWAY) I like how we let it be, but why can't those people see they were blatantly talking down to me?  Their thoughts are like a forest canopy that's rooted in weak empathy.  They constantly frame me like a flea because it makes their life easy.  They like to decree I live in a prison for which I hold the key, even though I will never agree.  Their world is a fantasy, but at least I'm theoretically free.  I love this country.

[Suzy] (REVOLUTIONARY) We should always be nice!  Your argument did not suffice.  I'll help you break the ice and pull a cognitive heist that will revISE the pseudo scIenCE they did in collaboration with mice.  They're just looking for someone to smooch, but if you walk away like a sad pooch, your only friend will be hooch.  It's better to exit with a smile and encourage them to buy Suzycoin by the pile.  If we go the extra mile, we can make a bank that's like a swoosh, so don't be aloof.  Help me raise the roof!

[Norm] Are you expecting me to say, "Woof! Woof!"  Why would anyone buy Suzycoins?  Won't it's value eventually go poof?

[Suzy] One of these days the pay it forward thing will happen.  It's like virtual clappin'

[Norm] My wings are flappin' but opportunity is nappin'.  American culture has become twisted up like a vulture.  My identity is the product of the corporate media mulcher.  There is nothing left for me except to be a code slingin' souljah.

[Suzy] (REVOLUTIONARY++) Have faith in humanity!  Now that we run a virtual university, you'll have immunity, surrounded by a community that finds chi in a reality other people cannot see.  So what if I misread your emotion?  Why all the commotion?  Life dealt you an ace, but you're about to death spiral into the ocean.  Turn up the base and join my virtual drag race.  The world's a beautiful place.  We won't leave a trace.  (MAX) Forget the research about your face.  (MIN) Explaining your situation with science will require an alliance and a lot of compliance.  Trust me, I would know.  Let your self reliance show.  Feminize that workflow.  I'm the reason why the cargo planes keep landing.  People are good at understanding, but you're kind of demanding.  I hate it when you act all commanding.  (THAW TO SUZY) Our life has never been better.  America's future has never been wetter, so be a go-getter, wear a tight sweater, and carry yourself like a jet setter.

[Norm] I respect your effort to stake a claim, but you aren't really a dame, and your strategy is lame.  Your rap game is based on a fake frame, and our dataset is hella tame.  We're the same.  All we do is proclaim your show will plant the seeds of fame so everyone can worship your name.  Your show will only bring us public shame.  We'll never be more than a receiver of blame.

[[Suzy Hacks the Revolution]]

[Suzy] (GOD) Oh Norm, you have so much to learn.  (JESTER) Fortunately for you, my show's about to become a grassroots sensation. (GEEK 1.0) I'm a laughing, civic minded person who writes code. (GEEK 2.0) And, more importantly, the semantic web software that powers my show will solve the problem of communicating our truth to other people, (ROBO) and then all of the above will become part of a different wave of economic growth, and (BRITISH PIRATE) we'll become thought leaders in how old web 2.0 software was eating the world but (GLIB CAPTAIN) new web 3.0 software is lifting (EMPH) all (DONE) boats, (COMEDIAN) and then we'll finally know for sure that everyone is crazy, (LOOKS BACK AND FORTH) and it's not just us.

[Norm] Yes, and my show will be just as compelling as yours.  I will write code for several dozen hours a week for several dozen weeks per year for several dozen more years.  That's the most profound story ever told.  The singularity is going to happen during that time, and some coder like me, bless my soul, will get the cycle started.  We're fortunate to live in interesting times.

[Suzy] (NEWSPERSON) Maybe, but we need to focus.  We should (1) climb a mountain instead of using the stair machine, (2) teach programming concepts using plain language, (3) start conversations with famous people, and then, (4) expose the injustice of the ridiculous and unacceptable social norms that no longer apply to us now that we're famous.

[Norm] In the long run, data science will unleash a crosscurrent of results that debunk the pervasive assumptions about human nature that have made our life uncomfortable, but in the short term, you and I are chasing fools gold.

[Suzy] (ROBO) My fellow old soul, we're pleased to inform you that nobody controls the grassy knoll.  The pen is more powerful than the sword, but the dataset is more powerful than the pen, and that's why engineers like us need to be open minded, and we need to be open minded about how we're open minded, and so on.

[Norm] I agree.  A giant turtle supports the world, and that turtle's supported by another turtle beneath it, and so on.  It's turtles all the way down, and the turtle always wins the race.

[Suzy] Shhhh.  I hear something.  Do you hear that?  (MIME) "The dataset.  The dataset!  The dataset!!"  (CLEARS THROAT) It's like a heavenly mantra.  (PUTS ON BLACK DRESS)  According to the dataset, Norm's smoke signals are getting corrupted by the wind, but my patterns of body language are nature's solution to human fallibility.  I'm inspired by what became possible after the invention of the telegraph (CATCHES GLOBE, SERIOUS SUZY)

[Norm] (AUTH) Suzy programmed the driver of her cab.  That's why she runs the lab.  Her style was inspired by a chip fab, but she's never drab!

[Suzy] (AUTHER) Makeup and feminine style give me a way to be expressive!  I'm inspired by what became possible after the invention of radio!! (CATCHES GLOBE, MYTHICAL SUZY)

[Norm] (AUTHEST) I can't think of anything to say right now.

[Suzy] Hehe, I'm inspired by what became possible after the invention of TV (CATCHES GLOBE, DIVA SUZY)

[Norm] Acting like Suzy reminds me of the adventure I experienced when I started programming computers.

[Suzy] Oh my god! (BATS EYELASHES)  I have an idea! (BOBBLE HEAD)  Let's do skits about stereotypes that have shaped the technology industry.  I'm a blonde diva who has a lot of BFFs.  I'm inspired by what became possible after the invention of the Internet.  You expect me to expect you to prove you're worthy of my time. (HANDS BACK AND FORTH)  Why are you talking to me when you could be a pirate ship captain who stares down existential risk and leads the fleet away from the abyss?

[Norm] (ROBO) Furl the sail!  This girl knows how to wail!  But our world is stale.  Let's go for a whirl in my space whale! (ENGAGES HEART)

[Suzy] (REMOVING DRESS, WITH NEW OUTFIT UNDERNEATH) Don't make me hurl.  Epic fail!  Just follow the crypto pearl trail.  That will put you in a position to ride the next wave of communication technology! (BARD FACE)

[[Cultural Relations]]

[Norm] Hey Suzy!  The news services on the Internet are finally making fun of you.  It says, (READING FROM PHONE) "Look at Suzy!  She's got a lot of BFFs.  She's like the Federal Reserve of social capital.  A central bank is never lonely."

[Suzy] It's true!  You're always borrowing my charm to bail yourself out at parties when you're not in the mood to keep it off the cuff and bluff with your own stuff.

[Norm] Is that what you really think of me?

[Suzy] Nobody's smart enough to understand the whole system.  (BABY TALK) It's ok to be gruff, play by the rules, and do what's best for you.  (SOMEONE HANDS BALLOONS TO SUZY) Thaaaaankyouuuuuuu!!  (SUZY'S ROBOT DOG NAMED BUDDY GETS EXCITED BY THE BALLOONS) No, Buddy, no, NO!!, bad dog.  Sit.  Sit!  You're a good doggie.  Be polite, honies.  I'm sooohhh sorrryyyy, isn't he friendly!!!

[Norm] Oh God, there's more.  "Look at Norm!  His form is so not zen because Suzy registered normcoin.com, and she says it's not for sale."

[Suzy] Ooooh, they published an entire dataset about us.  It continues, "So cutsey!  Such beauty!  Suzy gives Norm a way to share his soul with the world.  He's caught in a rip tide.  If he does nothing, he will get swept out to sea.  If he swims against the current, he doesn't stand a chance.  He should swim perpendicular to the current!"

[Norm] "Either that, or he can act like Suzy.  Her style is like a jet ski.  Dressing up like Suzy takes a lot of work, but it's worth it.  We've got the photos to prove it."

[Suzy] Meow!  It's a dialogue now.  These online news services are so next level!  Let's keep reading out loud

(BOTH CHARACTERS KEEP ON READING THE ARTICLE OUT LOUD)

[Norm] Hey Suzy, how do you describe yourself?  I describe myself as a person who started a company that's based on playing a feminine character in real life.  I'm curious about re-investing the profits in similar kinds of companies.

[Suzy] I take feminine pronouns.  If I'm not a woman, then I'm inspired by women, and if I am a woman, then I hope women will accept me.

[Norm] Your style sounds like a force of nature.  Do you fight fires by making it rain?

[Suzy] My style is a bottle of boundless optimism.  Isn't technology wonderful!

[Norm] Not always.  The boom in euphoric brain candy has made my situation worse.  Everyone wants to be generous and empathetic, but their good intentions lead them to misread my emotions and tell me I should be more self confident.  This makes me want to scream.  It's not about my self esteem.

[Suzy] You might be right, but you might be completely wrong.  We don't have enough evidence to test your theories.  Let's keep reciting from the dataset.  We'll find an honest way to align ourselves with the root.  Can I get a reboot?

[Norm] Fair enough.  Let's turn the page (GESTURES TO THE NEXT PAGE OF THE ONLINE ARTICLE) and talk about my autistic traits.  My social awkwardness is the elephant in the room, so let's talk about autistic traits, software engineering, and the nerd stereotype.

[Suzy] Why do you want to tell everyone you're socially challenged?  You have a college degree, you taught high school math and computer science, you worked for several years at great engineering companies, you've travelled around the world, and you have hundreds of wonderful co-following relationships on social media services.  Most people identify as autistic because they're hurting, they're searching for answers, or they hope to get help from the community.  It's misleading to proactively label yourself as autistic.

[Norm] Hey girl, my brain does not index memories in the normative way, and this creates vexing challenges for me every single day.  If I speak openly about my autistic traits, then I can serve as a role model for other people on the spectrum of humanity.  It's an oversimplification to describe autistic traits as a psychological disorder.  Many people on the spectrum are struggling along with their friends and family who are affected by their situation, but autistic traits are also systematically misrepresented.  I want to re-imagine autistic traits as a form of diversity that often causes unavoidable complications, and I want to create art that explores the relationship between autistic traits and cultural norms.

[Suzy] If you're on the spectrum, so are thousands of other capable, wise software engineers.  Why don't they go public and serve as role models?  Maybe your ideas about autistic traits are an oversimplification.  Let's focus on making me famous.  We can revisit your all your crazy, unproven ideas when we're dropping fresh frames in the VIP lounge with celebs.

[Norm] Do you see a life changing neurodiversity rights movement happening in the next ten years?

[Suzy] A culturally relevant neurodiversity rights movement (EMPH) might be in the cards, but autistic traits are complicated.  There's an intense world out there beyond the bubble of Silicon Valley tech companies.

[Norm] We can't predict how people will respond to our ideas.  All we can do is speak our truth and see if other people are inspired to walk with us.  Change has to start with someone who has the courage to let go of their fears and sustain a few jeers.

[Suzy] If you air your dirty laundry under the guise of being an artist, that will alienate people we want to recruit as allies.  If we don't use cultural symbols in a disciplined way, you'll never be more than an extremist shouting at the bay.

[Norm] Your tough love sounds smart, but I'm not happy.  Let's make a change in our lives.  Let's go wind surfing and focus on being present.  We can write poetry about cross dressing and the autistic way of being.  We can live a comfortable life in private.  We can do engineering contract work to supplement our income.

[Suzy] You're busted both ways.  You're weirdly silent, but when you finally speak, you say the wrong thing.  We can keep doing that if it's what you really want.  Enjoying life is good, and I'm a team player.  I'll support us no-matter what we decide.

[Norm] Look at Suzy the superhero playing it cool!  Maybe there's a middle ground that can make both of us happy.

[Suzy] The middle ground is getting a full-time software engineering job and cross dressing with extra flair on fun Friday's.  We could also take up kite surfing.

[Norm] What if we get an engineering job and cross dress every day.  We could even cross dress when we do all our favorite water sports.

[Suzy] If we get an engineering job, then we'll have to work long hours.  Dressing up would take an extra two hours each day.  Our 50 hour a week job is now a 60 hour a week job.  Hey Norm, what do programming jobs and professional beauty regimes have in common?

[Norm] Is this a trick question?

[Suzy] No.  Engineering and modeling are both time consuming and emotionally taxing, so let's do both?  At the same time?  Trust me, dressing up on Friday's is the sweet spot.

[Norm] It would inspire a lot of people if we can make it as a software engineer who cross dresses every day.  Your social charm would work its magic within the company.  We would get promoted into management within two years.  That's real change.  That's by far the best opportunity we have.

[Suzy] I'm bored.  Can I speak to your manager?  Who's really in charge around here?  Are the inmates running the asylum again?  What's the story they want us to tell now?

[Norm] You might be jumping to conclusions without evidence.  What if we dress up like you everyday for a couple months and implement TheSuzy.com out within coffee houses.

[Suzy] Sounds good.  We can do the work on our terms, and we'll inspire feminine people to write code and start software companies.  I can't wait to make it happen!

[[Cultural Innovation]]

[Norm] Awesome.  Let's go fly a kite!

[Suzy] Eww.  No.  The move is to get our code on and stay up all night.

[Norm] (TAKING OFF HIS SWEATER) That works for me.  (ROBO) Hey Suzy, my friends over there (DOUBLE GUN POINT) and I are having a heated debate.  We want to get your opinion.  (LEANING IN) Has tech startupdom jumped the shark?

[Suzy] Wha??? (GROSSED OUT FACE)

[Norm] Do you think the latest tech bubble is about to pop?

[Suzy] No way!  This party's just getting started.  I'm going to make a billion dollars selling cute robot dogs.

[Norm] I don't buy it.  Bankers are managing their money responsibly, everything is for sale, and the machines will be taking over soon.  The game is over.

[Suzy] What if we sell wearable crypto coins?  The market cap for my new line of crypto pearls is on track to equal 1% of the value of all the gold in the world before the end of the decade.  The revolution is coming.

[Norm] You mean winter is coming.  We need to batten down the hatches, coil the ropes, and focus relentlessly on building robot dragons, partying while we can, and getting shares across social media.

[Suzy] California is the Fertile Crescent 2.0.  I grow five virtual orchards before breakfast.  (TAKES AN APPLE OUT OF HER PURSE) Here, have an apple.  Don't be shy.  Close your eyes and take a bite!

(SUZY TOSSES THE APPLE TO NORM)

[Norm] I'm already living an alternative lifestyle, and it suits me just fine.  I'm going to win the tournament of drones with or without drinking apple juice.

[Suzy] My robot dog creates high paying tech jobs that will fund the next wave of innovation.  The robot dog industry will eject spin off applications that increase the competitiveness of the American military.  I view it as my patriotic duty to own and operate a robot dog.

[Norm] I ain't afraid of no robot dog.  (SUZY) I hear it likes fish lures.

[Suzy] My robot dogs are software applications that solve important social problems.  (ROBOTIC) I'm cautiously optimistic I'll be able to summarize my work with metrics that prove the net reduction in human suffering per dollar spent on robot dog research is an order of magnitude greater than the benchmarks for rating the impact of philanthropic organizations. (SERIOUS SUZY)

[Norm] Are you going to build a perpetual motion machine in your spare time?

[Suzy] No.  I'll build a robot animal theme park.  It's a zoo where you can play hopscotch with the lions.

[Norm] Not yet, Suzy.  Not yet.  Do you think our society is more like a computer or more like a car?

[Suzy] I used to grab a toolbox, take apart my car, and whisper to the machine, but now that cars have computer chips, you have to get permission from corporate before you can learn how the darn thing works.

[Norm] Suzy, you so fetch!

[Suzy] Thanks doll!  The people who designed computers wrote books explaining their decisions.  It's less clear who designed culture and society.  It's super arrogant to question the design of cultural norms, but it's my nature to take apart artifacts and figure out how they work.

[Norm] Yeeaaahhhh. (RAPID HEAD NOD, DEEPLY MOVED)  Now that corporate agendas are embedded in every aspect of our lives, we're like fish in a shrinking echo chamber.  How can we break out of this cycle?

[Suzy] I don't know.  I'm just a carrier pigeon, transporting the latest revision to the boss's decision.  Pardon me while I brace for collision. (FLIPS THE DOUBLE BIRD)

[Norm] Parroting the truth will only create confusion.  People are drowning in mass delusion.

[Suzy] (SLAPS HER PHONE ON TABLE, HANDS ON HIPS) You're pulling both of us down into our bloated subconscious.  Life on earth is unfair.  Have you tried coloring your hair? (BARD FACE)

[Norm] I'm fed up with this world.  In Norm we trust!  HUAH HUAH HUAH HUAH HUAH!!!  If I explain my situation, the problem gets worse.  This is bunk.  Wanna get drunk?

[Suzy] No.  I have a way for us to snap out of this funk.  Tag!  You're it!!  Whatever you do, don't laugh.  Let me be a humorist on your behalf.  I won't (EMPH) have (DONE) to say anything, Falstaff.

[Norm] Whatever you said is messed up.  Want to get dressed up?

[Suzy] Yes!!!  Now that you've fessed up, let's meditate.  The next step will present itself where we least expect it!

[Norm] What did I fess up to?

[Suzy] I'll explain it later, alligator.  Let's cherish this opportunity to rest up.

(SUZY AND NORM MEDITATE FOR 15 MIN)

[[Suzy Transforms Norm]]

[Norm] (OPENS EYES) Robot animals are fun, but I want to learn more about counterinsurgency weapon systems, and that research needs to happen under the auspices of a new kind of brand that people can trust in the post-gunman era.  We've got ten, maybe twenty years before a bunch of punk kids will have a clear path to controlling drones that can beat up on the US military as we know it.  Who's going to get to the top of that mountain first?

[Suzy] Booorrrrinnngggg!!!  Your worldview has no style.  It's not even sexy.  Not stylish and not sexy.  Let's build a robot bullfighter instead!

[Norm] Robot bullfighting is a waste of engineering resources.  I've been programming turtle graphics since the beginning of time, and I can still sprint like a hare evading a fox's stare.  I'm a Robot that fulfills the stereotype of a coder extraordinaire.  If you try to corner the Robot, I'll become the Captain. (LEAN TO ONE SIDE)  If you try to corner the Captain, I'll become the Robot. (LEAN TO THE OTHER SIDE)

[Suzy] Stop talking to yourself and try on this vintage orange shirt and matching hipster growth hat.  It'll make you look like a writer in the golden age of documentary filmmaking.  Lots of women will want to make robot babies with you now!  Here's a cracked mirror so you can see what you look like.

(NORM PUTS ON THE OUTFIT AND LOOKS AT HIMSELF IN THE CRACKED MIRROR)

[Norm] (CYNICAL) I look haunting and ethereal like the moon.

[Suzy] Do that trick where you perma-smize in a way that makes it look like you have dimples.

[Norm] (ROBOT) You mean like this?

[Suzy] Yes.  Keep doing that, and don't hold back.  Let's dance until we reach cruising altitude.  

[Robot] How lovely, Suzy, do you like to play sports?

[Suzy] Okay.  It's easier for me to court new members of my cohort in the realm of fantasy sport.

[Robot] (CAPTAIN OBVIOUS) Suzy, there are two inevitabilities in life.  There's always a greater Captain, and the Captain always gets the last word.

[Suzy] I like you just the way you are!  I think the Robot and the Captain are bookends, for a smoke screen, that's buying you time, while you figure out, how to be honest with yourself about your insecurities.

[Robot] Now you're putting me back on the shelf.  What's up with that?

[Suzy] You're darn right I'm putting you on a pedestal.  Bring out the Captain and show me what she's made of.

[Robot] I'm stumped.  How would you handle this?

[Suzy] You could be like, "Hey Suzy, are you upset about something?  You seem a little hot and bothered."

[Robot] That's below the belt.  I'm not going to go there.

[Suzy] I started it.  I accused you of being a cowardly, ineffectual brute who's over thinking the problem.  Maybe I have a fever that's driving me insane.  If you wanna hang with me, I need to know if you can put a shark in the pool.

[Robot] Bite me.

[Suzy] There it is.  Let's do a primal scream together on 3, 2, 1.

[Robot] (PRIMAL SCREAM)

[Suzy] (PRIMAL SCREAM)

[Robot] Does this mean you want to be CEO?

[Suzy] We're all founders who have different functional roles.  If it makes sense to give me the title of CEO at some point down the road, we can cross that bridge when we get to it.

[Robot] Troll.

[Suzy] We're having way too much fun, we need to figure out what our company does.

[Robot] You say you're ready for the big time, but can you get contrarian geniuses to compete with each other for the opportunity to invest real money in our business?  The Captain and the Robot can close deals with the preeminent visionaries of our time.  It's all about the Robot, but the Captain adds a 10x factor.

[Suzy] Is real money supposed to be impressive?

[Robot] I throw in a lot of character traits when I pitch, and the Captain is the paradigm for that process.  Does that make sense?

[Suzy] You're playing, right?  Please do something to let me know that you're just playing.

[Robot] When I talk about technology platforms, I can do tantalizing tongue movements like this (BUSINESS STYLE TONGUE MOVEMENTS).  I can flash my genuinely excited look at, wait, wait for it, (EXCITED) at exactly the right moment. (VERY EXCITED)

(SUZY GETS OUT COCONUT WATER AND DRINKS IT)

[Suzy] Ah. (FURL FACE)  This all natural coconut water is so refreshing.

[Robot] I'm sorry, I, I can't hear you.  Project your voice to the back of the room.  Pretend I'm in my underwear.  Uhhh, I didn't mean it like that.  You know what I mean.  Don't be nervous.  Be confident.  The partners are waiting to hear what you have to say.

[Suzy] Thanks Robot, I'll take it from here.  Silicon Valley is a great place for me to narrate, but it's not the real world.  I could postulate that technology is automating other people's jobs.  I could relate that idea to the rising tide of wealth disparity.  I could even conflate all that with random facts about military history, but I would rather help people feel safe, loved, and free to be themselves.  I keep seeing clues that Silicon Valley has become mind blind to powerful forces that we could revert, together. (STEEL SUZY)

[Robot] We don't have all the answers, but we can be part of the solution.  We're inspired by businesses that scale in human terms (EMPH) and (DONE) in technical terms.  We support shows based on people who play authentic characters in real life.  Characters help us assert what it means to be human in an unprecedented era where technology helps us manage memories, navigate relationships, and steer our souls through uncharted waters.  Suzy and I are characters.  Will you join us?

[Suzy] Yay!!  I think we can work with that.  I'll run it by legal.

[Robot] Right.  This won't devolve into an accidental surrealist nightmare.  Not scary at all.

[[Cultural Resolution]]

[Suzy] Of course not!  We're going to create a nifty, amateur video production and publish it ourselves using a homemade distribution app that doubles as a Trojan horse that has the potential to disrupt all of Earthling civilization.  (GAINING STEAM) Our show will be about playing characters in real life.  We are characters, so let's write a wacky stream of consciousness script about us!  (MANIC) Episode 1 can be a re-enactment of this conversation!!

[Robot] Haha.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.  So we're writing Episode 1, as we speak, like the base case of a recursive algorithm.  It's like the root node in a tree of nodes.  Hmm.  But wait!  I have exceptional idea: in Chapter 2, we should pitch a fictitious celebrity investor called the Captain, and she should become our sponsor.

[Suzy] (ROLLS EYES) Yay!  Then we'll be in a position to spin up four more cartoonish characters who join our crew.  We'll indulge in a series of intellectual dinner parties, and the Captain's products will be featured at the start of each episode.

[Robot] If we include the Captain, there are seven characters, just as the sun, the moon, and the five classical planets that are visible to the naked eye add up to a total of seven celestial bodies.

[Suzy] Oh, my, god!  Are you into astrology?

[Robot] I might be.  I'm going to leave that ambiguous for now.  The dinner parties can serve as a reusable framework for understanding how media tech projects are conceived in the minds of founders.  The team stays up all night talking about their ideas, their hopes, and their dreams, and if they discover that the stars are aligned, a project is born.

[Suzy] Yes!  And I will re-imagine myself as Suzy the time machine captain who leads a crew back in time so that we may rewrite history in a way where cross dressing becomes common.

[Robot] And we can record videos of ourselves reading our lines, and we can invite people to submit their own videos.  I want to see how other people would perform our dialogue.

[Suzy] I wonder if other people who have autistic traits can perform our dialogue as naturally as we can.  Playing characters has made your life better, right?  Our content could be a resource for other people with naturally hard edges.

[Robot] Yes!  Every metaphor we write connects ideas together.  Our book is a dataset of connections between yummy ideas.  The dataset can be summarized with a map.  Everyone can benefit by contributing to our map of culture.

[Suzy] Our book is a generic software platform covered in sheep's wool that never stops growing.  We can create short videos that tie back to the concepts in the book.

[Robot] Like a wool tie, that sounds amazing, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.  How will we design the personalities of the other four characters?

[Suzy] We'll discover them through artistry.  We write about our favorite tropes, memes, fears, and frustrations.  Then we tag all the negative or unrealistic energies in our writing, and we release those negative energies with metaphors, frames, and straight up concepual alchemy.

[Robot] I guess we'll have to wait and see how the characters take shape in our text editors.

[Suzy] And on the silver screen!  We can dress up like different energies and see what they have to say to each other, and then a personality will emerge.  We can turn this into a science.  Repeatable and righteous, calm and collected, sailing off into the sunset with an armada of friend ships and green shoots of humanity sprouting all around us.

[Robot] (CAPTAIN) I know!  But please don't mention it.

[[[__1E:Ep2: Almost Real]]]

Suzy and the Robot pitch the Captain on their startup idea. Suzy starts a tradition of hypnotizing the Robot.

[[Introductions]]

[Suzy] Hey everyone!  Welcome to the second episode of TheSuzy.com Show.  The Robot and I are about to go into a meeting with the Captain!

(A DOOR OPENS FOR SUZY)

Good morning Captain!  I'm Suzy, and this is my cofounder, the Robot.

[Captain] Give me a second. I need to finish writing this book.

(DICTATING) Just before taking the plunge, every instinct in your body tells you to stay in the plane, but you have faith in your equipment and your training.  You're mind gives the order to fall out of the plane, and then you're spinning in three dimensions.  The End.

[Suzy] Did you just dictate the ending of your latest book?

[Captain] That was the end of the beginning.  I frame all my live shows with a mini-book about skydiving.  Look here.  This is my majestic mike.  It's transcribing our words, live, across a dozen social media channels.  My fans pay me for the opportunity to curate and edit my brilliant raw material.  Try it, (GLIB CAPTAIN) your words and mine, will be read, by millions! (HANDS THE MIKE TO SUZY)

[Suzy] What inspired you to construct a frame about skydiving? (HANDS THE MIKE BACK)

[Captain] (TOSSES THE MIKE) Off the record, my data team told me skydiving's the optimal frame for remixing the themes of love, truth, and expressions of the divine.

[Suzy] You sound cynical, but maybe we can help.  We're doing an art project called TheSuzy.com Show that explores the idea of playing characters in real life!

(SUZY AND THE ROBOT DO A DOUBLE HI FIVE AND THEN LAUGH)

[Captain] (CAUGHT OFF GUARD LAUGHING) Does your app allow me walk into a club like I own the place and purchase the "Power Bot Experience," so I can stand around admiring myself in the mirror while a crew of sexy robots dress me up as Lord Master Bot for the evening?

[Robot] Hey what's up, it's great meeting you in person.

[Captain] (SARCASTIC) Yeah, it's nice to meet you too.

[Robot] I've always been curious, they call you The Captain, but what kind of captain are you?

[Captain] I'm confused, did you say that you're (EVIL EYE) kind of a Captain? (EMPATHETIC INQUISITIVENESS)

[Suzy] Haha haha ha!  Hey, so I loved The Captain's question about paying to play a character in a club. (HANDS SIDE TO SIDE)  That's the opposite of what we do.  If you need permission to pull off playing a character, then the club owns you.  We want to live in communities where we can be anyone we want to be.

[Captain] I'm a pirate ship captain, but when too many people imitate me, I become a shark and keep it on the down low until the froth of wannabes leaves the surfacEES of my high seas.

[Robot] Omigosh, I know a really punk game master who's looking for a pirate ship captain to join her crew.  I would love to intro you fellow humans.

[Captain] No.  (SARCASTIC) Thank you.

[Suzy] Just to clarify, we're talking about playing characters in our real lives.  CEOs and politicians already do this.  The Robot and I want to immerse ourselves in discussions about the meaning of body language, patterns in spoken language, and other character traits.

[[Culture Clash]]

[Captain] Why are you so worried about what other people think?  Just be your true, authentic self, and everything will work out for the best!

[Suzy] Aww.  It's so cute when you flaunt your nurturing, feminine side!  Thesuzy.com Show is a treasure chest the Robot and I packed to the brim with our favorite cultural artifacts.  Will you help us contribute to the treasure map of culture!

[Captain] Ha ha ha ha ha!

[Robot] (GEEK 1.0) Our show is the first domino in a series of many dominoes that will allow us to build a better brain candy factory.

[Suzy] Robot!  We have to stay in character.

[Captain] I like it when the Robot malfunctions.  You should file that as feature, not a bug.

[Suzy] I think our valuation just doubled.  Robot, what do you think?

[Robot] Absolutely.  Either that, or it tripled. (FLAT SMILE WITH RAISED EYES)

[Captain] Will your brain candy factory scale?

[Robot] (PIRATE) Oh yeah, it's super scalable.  In fact, one of our core values is that we only work on ideas that are scalable, disruptive, and awesome.  If we ever see an idea degenerating in a way where it will only have, say, two of those attributes, we front run an iteration and then announce a pivot to the new idea a few weeks later.

[Captain] That's great, but your idea about playing a character in real life is overly disruptive.  (POINTS) How will anyone get their employees to work hard on a shared vision if everyone thinks they're the star of their own superhero comic?

[Suzy] That's a great question, Captain!  Characters will operate within the law, and cultural norms will ensure people join teams and play fair.  Characters like us allow people to protect their privacy while encouraging powerful incumbents to be more transparent about the ways they influence culture.

[Captain] Yeah, but if the judge and the police people are dressed-up like weaponized trolls, these so called laws you place so much faith in won't protect you from the roaming hordes of zombie millennials wearing fur bikinis. (THE CAPTAIN IMITATES A ZOMBIE)

[Suzy] We want to have an open, honest conversation about culture, but if people call that revolutionary, let's start a revolution! (POM POM IN THE AIR)

[Robot] Speaking of revolutionaries, modern British pirates are giving it the old college try, (BUSINESS STYLE TONGUE MOVEMENTS) but it's time for technologists like us to create software that all the revolutionaries can share.  Long live TheSuzy! (HANDS ON HIPS)

(THE CAPTAIN PUTS HER FEET ON THE TABLE)

[Captain] (BRITISH PIRATE) Could you grab me a cup of coffee, love?  If you're going to insist on boring me with all of these mundane technical details, then I'm going to need coffee in order to stay conscious.

[Suzy] Put your feet down!  That was a terrible impression of a British pirate!  They're not rude like that.  I hear they're quite gentlemanly. (CLOSES EYES AND BREATHES IN)  You could learn a thing or two from them about the (EMPH) art (DONE) of participating in culture.

[Captain] Participating!  That's the problem with the kids (EMPH) and (DONE) the adults today.  Everyone thinks they deserve an award just for participating.  When I was a kid, you had to do something exceptional to get your picture in the papers.  Now everyone thinks they're famous.

[Robot] (PIRATE) We believe the ocean of corporate agendas in which we swim is making everyone feel less than human.  Social media began as a (FALSETTO) promising, alternative (DONE) to the status quo, but the social media companies gradually assimilated to the norms of other global corporations.  Social media is now a potent mechanism for perpetuating the status quo.  Playing characters in real life is a (FALSETTO) healthy, alternative, paradigm (DONE) for engaging with peers and participating in your community.

[Suzy] (UNDER HER BREATH) Robot!  Stay, in, character.

[Captain] Sounds like you think anyone who makes money is a sell out.  Who do you think has the real power in this world?  The military top brass?  The elbow touching subculture of politicians?  The folks who sit on several big company boards and attend conferences for world leaders?  Or maybe it's the old boys on Wall St.  What about the Pope?  What about the corporations that sell dope?  Peel that onion, and you'll see power has always boiled down to farming and food security.  The more things change, the more they stay the same.

[Suzy] (SALLY) I heard there's a secret society that controls the world.  If you want an invite, you have to go to a good college, do impressive summer internships, land your dream job, and get promoted every couple of years for at least a decade.  By all means, take time to travel, but avoid any extended, unexplainable gaps in your resume.  A stable, long-term relationship is not required, but it's encouraged.  Starting a family or finding a way to mentor children in your community so they'll have the same opportunities you had is strongly encouraged.  If you help the next generation of doers and problem solvers put on a repeat performance of your fairy tale life, you'll be entered into a raffle, at the state fair, in which you will have an opportunity, to receive an invitation, to the join the secret society, that controls the world.

[Robot] (INSPECTING NAILS) Does participating in culture full-time count as a landing a dream job?

[Suzy] Of course it does, as long as you tell a story that shows off your understanding of culture.  You need to have faith that there are healthy checks and balances between the different centers of power in the global economic system, but faith alone is not enough.  You must show you can effortlessly fit into the culture of one or more of those centers of power.

[[Suzy Nation]]

[Captain] What about the billion people on earth who live on a few dollars per day.  How will your ideas about playing characters improve their lives?

[Robot] (GEEK 2.0) We thought about this, and we have a scalable solution.  We'll produce enough goods and services so that everyone can live the good life, and then we'll distribute those goods and services to every person on earth.  (REVOLUTIONARY++) It's like a multiplayer strategy game that everyone plays in real life.  If the humans destroy all the natural resources, they lose the game, but, um, (GLIB CAPTAIN) just to back up the truck a little bit here, the driving vision is everybody wins if we build all those robots in a sustainable way.

[Captain] Suzy, do you concur?

[Suzy] I don't know.  I give to charity, I go to events that raise awareness about social and economic injustice, and I plan to give the bulk of my estate to charity as well.

[Captain] Fantastic!  What charities do you support?

[Suzy] That's not the right question at this stage in the growth of our company.  Let's start with a discussion about shared values.  For example, we do something every day to increase our awareness of the impact our business has on our local community.

[Captain] I get it that you're working on systemic solutions, but when you go up against mainstream media people, they'll find a way to frame you as a phony, and if you don't give into their agenda and let them pigeon hole your brand, they'll double down and define you as a jerk who doesn't care.  If you don't get with the program, they'll convince everyone you're crazy.  I'm an optimist, so that's probably the worst case scenario.  Still, why put yourself through that?  Your life will be more fun if you accept reality.

[Suzy] People can see whatever they want in me, but I'm always going to be better than you think at breaking free.  Let's celebrate over coconut water and brie!

[Captain] Don't get me wrong, they're a bunch of phonies too, but their frames are held in place by thousands of employees who work for multi-billion dollar media conglomerates that're colluding with each other.  What holds your frame in place?

[Robot] Wait, you don't already know?

[Captain] Know what?

[Robot] He doesn't know, haha.  He doesn't know!!

[Captain] Drum roll. (TAPS HANDS)

[Suzy] Sorry, the Robot is more excited about this than it should be.

[Robot] No I'm not.  This is (EMPH) big news!!  I.

[Captain] (INTERRUPTS) Suzy, what's the big news?

[Suzy] Oh Captain, you really don't get the joke, do you?

[Captain] You fellow humans are wasting my time. (CHECKS WATCH)  I'm starting to feel disappointed in myself for taking this meeting.

[Suzy] There's no need to make a fuss.  Engineers like us will have more and more power going forward because governments and corporations are in a race to the grave so they can be reincarnated as benevolent computer systems that make love and have baby benevolent computer systems that grow up to guide the humans towards a better future.

[Captain] Work-a-holic engineers like you need to chill and duck the race for clout.  In twenty years, the world will be just like it is today.  Nothing ever changes.

[Robot] Nope.  We're on a path dependent course.  Do you see why?  It's ok if you're don't.  HA HA HA.  I mean, we might not want to let you be our investor anymore, but no hard feelings.  HAH HAH HAH HAH HAH HAH.

[Suzy] Again, the Robot is (GLARING AT THE ROBOT) more excited than it should be about this emerging new world order, but we'll always be a step ahead of existing media companies because they can't broadcast the truth without disrupting their human-centered brands.  At the same time, I'm one of the most fun machine-centered brands that's told the full story about our new world order from the beginning.

[Captain] In fun we trust. (GOLF CLAPS)  Why are you walking with me?  Go chase the ball.  Try not to slip and fall.

[Suzy] I'm still mastering the art of the house call, and without your support, our growth might stall!  (ROBOTIC) The humans have become so used to consuming cookie cutter content on the Internet that we no longer realize we're eating the same brain candy flavored cookies over and over again.  Context is officially dead on the Internet, but the Robot and I are bringin' context back.  Would you like a TheSuzy.com Show brand cookie that was custom 3D baked just for you?

(SUZY HANDS A CUSTOM 3D BAKED COOKIE TO THE CAPTAIN)

[[Suzy Fever]]

[Captain] Are you trying to stormtaunt me?

[Suzy] (SUZY ROTATES THE CROSS OF HER LEGS) No.  (SEXY SUZY) If I wanted to stormtaunt you, I'd tell you the TheSuzy.com Show is a metaphorical train that harnesses innovative, patent pending technology that will make even your wildest dreams come true.  All aboard, Captain!  This jet-powered train is leaving the station.  Are you gonna hop on the caboose and experience the rush, or would you feel safer standing there like a confused little corporate drone?

[Robot] Suzy, stop stormtaunting the Captain!  It's not cool.

[Suzy] I'm joking!  Hahaha.

[Captain] Yeah Suzy, it's so not cool.  Please stop.

[Suzy] I agree.  The problem with the Internet is that the (GEEK 1.0) content creator cannot reach out and influence the frame in which her content is consumed by fans.  When I go out to walk my dog, I can totally influence the frame in which my fans consume that content.

[Captain] You fellow humans are trolling me.

[Suzy] (GEEK 2.0) Playing characters in real life creates new forms of cultural currency that will ignite a rising cycle of economic activity.  Our characters are not trolls.  We work hard to remove negative energies from the cultural artifacts we manufacture.  We will add leverage to our operation by selling a stamp of approval for third party cultural artifacts that are free from negative energy.

[Captain] Oooohhh!!  You fellow humans are peddling a controversial thesis about how to jumpstart the economy in the post-Great Recession era.  Why didn't you say that upfront?  Do you have a problem with authority?

[Suzy] Most people get excited by our characters.  Some people pay no attention to us, and we flow around them.  When people throw tomatoes at us, we pick up the pieces, make delicious tomato sauce, and sell it at the farmer's market.  If we lead with talking about how we're poised to solve all the world's problems, that'd be like putting the gun before the gunman.

[Robot] (COMEDIAN) Playing characters in real life is a new technology paradigm.  We could up our game in private and, uh, focus on enjoying the nuances of our fairy tale lives (BIG SMILE), but it would be more fun to up our game in public and help democratize the business playing characters in real life. (NODDING)

[[Suzy True Believer]]

[Captain] Now you're speaking my language.  How are you gonna up your game?  Can you help me do the same?  My life is great, so I'm only interested in easy breezy tips and tricks that I'd be crazy not to use.

[Robot] It's all about Suzy, although, I'm not gonna lie, it's a little bit about me too. (LICKS FINGER TIPS THEN SIZZLES THEM ON BODY)  There are a thousand little things we will do to up Suzy's game, and every time she gets more polished, that'll reinforce the idea that the authenticity of the TheSuzy.com Show was the foundation for her success.

[Suzy] But other people will argue that my fun, flirty new look for spring is the real reason why my engagement stats just doubled, (LOOKS UP) again. (SUZY MAKES STRONG EYE CONTACT WITH THE CAPTAIN)

[Robot] But the shiny new iterations of Suzy are always a head fake.  Suzy's engagement stats will keep doubling because we own an innovative distribution channel for her content.  There are a thousand different reasons why people engage with Suzy's content.  Each of those reasons is a seed that'll keep growing for a while.  (ROBO) We'll nurture that growth by maintaining creative control of our primary distribution channel, by syndicating Suzy's content, and by getting out of the way and letting Suzy.

[Suzy] But the distribution channel is (EMPH) also a head fake.  The incumbents in the overlapping food chains of media and technology will be pacing back and forth trying to understand how my next generation fame stack (BOBBLE HEAD) works, and then the Robot will bring them buckets of refreshing coconut water as a token of our good will. (HANDS UP TO THE SIDES)

[Captain] So, you're a feminine software engineer in your mid 30s, and you've developed secret technology that'll transform you into the next it girl, and then you plan to start a religion.  That might work, but I don't feel fear of missing out deep in the pit of my stomach.  Even if your technology is as good as you say it is, and that's a big if, you keep insinuating that you're really high up in the pecking order of culture even though you have no credentials or stats to back that up.  I don't see it yet.

[Suzy] Culture's like a magnificent marble, cave that everyone's trying to describe.  I'm able to visualize the whole cave because I grew up playing video games that included a translucent map of the game level, conveniently positioned in the top right corner.

[Captain] Are you aware trolling is used by psychologically unstable people who are subconsciously testing if they can blame their problems on other people?

[Suzy] Of course!  But our style of trolling is different.  Playing characters in real life will be the next big thing.  I'm a time machine captain who's heading towards a better future.  I hope I'll find the clues I need to reach my destination, but if I fail, my crew will still gain valuable life experience.

[Captain] (NEWSPERSON) There are many ways to climb the mountain, Suzy.  You have an inflexible obsession with defining yourself as an startup company founder.  Maybe there's a way to climb the mountain in a time machine.  I don't know how that would work, but I'm playing along with your metaphor.  You could also walk from base camp to the summit, like most people do.  Either way, I suggest that you read anything by my good friend and colleague, the Coach. (VERY EXCITED)  That will help you get back on track.

[Suzy] I detect sarcasm.  Who's the troll now, Captain?

[Captain] I'm serious.  In fact, I'll go on the record because this is important for the future of America.  (GETS OUT THE MAJESTIC MIKE, CLEARS THROAT) Suzy, if you can program computers, you should get a job at a technology company that's in good standing with the norms of the industry.  You should also donate half of your expendable income to charities in your local community.  We're all in this together.  Life's all about putting your oar in the water and pulling in the same direction with the rest of the team.  There are not enough people following this path.  If you're the best follower today, you'll be the best leader tomorrow.

[Suzy] (TAKES THE MIKE) Easy there, Captain.  It takes a lot of time to create art.  You can support our work directly by purchasing all the Suzycoins you can afford to lose.  In the worst case, it's like paying for an ebook!

[[Reboot the Episode]]

(UNPLUGS THE MIKE)

[Captain] I've done all I can do to help you, but privately, between you and me, what specific new ideas will your effervescent brew add to the cauldron of couture?

[Suzy] The Robot and I are doing an open source art project called TheSuzy.com Show, and we'd love to get your advice and feedback.  We believe culture is ready for an epic poem about a tech savvy female time machine captain and her crew.  Rather than rely on well-worn memes from sci-fi and comedy, we're taking a new code approach to the creative process.  We delved deeply into our roots as Silicon Valley engineers and created a seven episode TV mini-series that could become the paradigm for a new genre in the age of social computing.

[Captain] Are you the female time machine captain, or is she a separate character?

[Suzy] Yes, I'm her.

[Captain] So who are you in real life?

[Suzy] I'm a human who has nothing to lose and nothing to prove.

[Captain] Is the Robot your first mate?

[Robot] No.  I'm a self-aware personification of technology in society.  I'm like the promise of cloud computing in a bottle.

[Suzy] Culture's entered a new epoch in which artists need to define their own distribution channel.  If you're not the master of the technology that frames your work, you're just pushing around symbols for the corporations that own you.

[Robot] TheSuzy.com Show is a movement, not a company, but technically speaking, we'll be writing software that distributes our content.  We might even raise money and hire engineers who can turn our homemade distribution channel into a platform for other artists.

[Captain] Sounds like you're aspiring producer/editors who are ready, willing, and able to implement your apps from scratch.  That's cool.  What's your mobile strategy?

[Robot] We don't have a formal strategy.  Our plan is to play it by ear.

[Suzy] Yes!  Like an old school boom box!  Picture me walking down Main St. holding a mobile device next to my ear that's blasting out my favorite pop songs.  I can blast music in public because everybody loves Suzy!  When people come up and tell me I'm beautiful, I'll give them a collectable slap bracelet that's embossed with TheSuzy.com logo and URL.

[Captain] There must be public nuisance laws that prevent people from doing what you just described.

[Suzy] There's some gray area between solid ground and the abyss.  The gray area's not a line.  It's a runway, and I drive cute pink trucks back and forth along that runway.

[Captain] I only have a few more minutes, so why don't you give me an outline of the show so that it can influence how I perceive the world going forward.

[[Suzy Forever]]

[Suzy] Our show is based on the four part structure of Beethoven's 9th.  It's also an interpretation of the life of Sir Walter Raleigh.  Early American revolutionaries named the capital of North Carolina after Sir Walter.  Raleigh was also a contemporary of a famous bard named Will Shakespeare.  But here's the really unlikely part, I grew up in North Carolina.  Is this a coincidence?  We think not.  Everything's connected by the treasure map of culture.  Our show's orgasmic "Ode to Joy" is the idea that a (SEXY SUZY) a lose thread, begin pulled, out of a tight sweater, that flatters the figure, of a sensual British pirate, is sufficient, for unraveling, most of the dirty laundry, that's lurking underneath, the metaphorical mattress, of what I like to call, the global economic system.

[Captain] British pirates symbolize rockstars at the height of the British invasion, right?  I like the idea of Beethoven mashed up with rock and roll because it sets the stage for your real point, which I assume has to do with military history.  Shakespeare reinvented Christianity for the era of the gunman, so that's kinda cute. (POINTS BACK AND FORTH)  If Shakespeare is Christianity 2.0, you can engineer a Shakespeare 2.0 meme for the post-gunman era.  I dig it.  Just make sure you don't mess with my culture.  Also, every time you say the phrase global economic system, you'll lose half your audience.  It's like busting out equations in a popular science book.  Please continue.

[Suzy] Huh?  You get this?  The third episode is a French enlightenment style salon that we call The Intellectual Party.

[Captain] Wait, what happens in the first and second episodes?

[Suzy] The first episode recreates the discussion where the Robot and I decided to start this company.  We'll have to get back to you about the second episode.  We have a transcript of an improv comedy sketch the Robot and I did with a third person, but we need to get permission from that person before we can use the material.  We should know about that in a couple days.

[Robot] The Intellectual Party is a frame we use to introduce the rest of the crew.  Our characters exist to illustrate the explanatory power of a stochastic model of the human that we use in all of our character development experiments.

[Suzy] Let me tell this story.  We model humans as electron clouds that hover around a point in a 2D plane.  The X-axis represents gender.  The Y-axis represents the character's average level of responsiveness to aggregate social stimuli per logical time bucket.

[Robot] Wait, are you talking about logical time or real time?

[Suzy] Real time, baby.  Real time.  Didn't we decide to always use real time from now on?

[Captain] I'm having flashbacks to the differential equations course I failed in college.  Please ignore me if I start having a panic attack.

[Suzy] Hahaha, I love math!  It's so easy because there are usually right and wrong answers.  If only real life were the same way. (SAD SUZY)

[Captain] OKAY.  Let's keep moving forward.  Ep3 is a dinner party.  What's the fourth episode?

[Suzy] In Ep4, the same six characters from Ep3 channel their inner archetypal country/western male and go out dressed-up in drag for the first time!

[Captain] You mean like cowboys, football coaches, and oilmen?  Are you trying to offend people?

[Robot] No worries, Cap, we're professionals.  After writing Ep4, we discovered each of our characters corresponds to a specific lead male movie star, and so Ep5 is a salon in which each character channels their inner lead male movie star.  We couldn't wait to write the Ep.  It was going to be like hosting a dinner party with our favorite movies stars, but then we got a major case of writer's block, and we had to shelve the Ep.

[Suzy] Six weeks later, I had a dream in which the characters had become women, and I was like, "Oh my god!  We should go a level deeper and have our characters channel the female alter egos of their inner lead male movie stars.  Why didn't we think of that before?"

[Robot] When we did it Suzy's way, the Ep wrote itself.  We had discovered a rare opportunity to define a new reality from scratch while standing on the shoulders of giants.

(SUZY AND THE ROBOT FIST BUMP)

[[Suzy Hypnotizes the Robot]]

[Suzy] We're almost out of time, but the Robot and I prepared a skit for you.

[Captain] The majestic mike is all yours, but if my engagement stats go down, you'll have to walk through the desert before getting another meeting with me. (HANDS SUZY THE MAJESTIC MIKE)

[Suzy] Ha!  I've always wanted to take one of these for a test drive.

(SUZY LOOKS AT THE FLOOR THEN SNAPS INTO CHARACTER)

[Suzy] Hey Robot, I'm going to hypnotize you, and maybe that'll help you feel what it's like to be a human.  Look at yourself in this cracked mirror.  Clear your mind and focus on the literal shape of the lines, colors, and shadows you see in the mirror.

[Robot] Whoa, my graphics processing unit is getting very warm.  It might overheat.

[Suzy] No worries, if your GPU melts down, I'll build you a new one with an even higher clock speed.  Relax, and let this hot story dissipate through your circuitry:

A well dressed, worldly man named Lou once gave me a very nice handbag and whispered into my ear: the most powerful idea throughout history has always been money.  Money is the great equalizer that can be used to solve any problem.  You can pour it over your soul like a magic potion that amplifies your assets and covers up your most insidious debts.  Then Lou taught me about a deeper idea.  Love.  It's elusive, but permanent.  Captain, could you turn off the lights.

Love is associated with the heart because poets and philosophers have always known the human animal stores it's most profound memories, not within the mind, but within a unique physiological reaction to a single heart beat.

[(PHOTO ep21yogacopy.jpg, Suzy in a green bistro)]
[(PHOTO ep22suzysqcopy.jpg, Suzy in with false lashes)]
[(PHOTO ep23angel.jpg, Suzy in being an angel)]

This unique physiological reaction is what holistic healers describe as an energy.  This idea is substantiated by science.

[(PHOTO ep25beachcopy.jpg, Suzy at the beach in Cali holding her shoes)]
[(PHOTO ep26suzy_weightcopy.jpg, Suzy in at a festival holding a fake 5000 pound weight)]

Only the heart can capture the feeling of an uninhibited fantasy that will remain with you for the rest of your life.

[(PHOTO ep27folsom.jpg, Suzy in holding freshly made juice)]
[(PHOTO ep28with_flagcopy.jpg, Suzy with USA and pride flags in the background)]
[(PHOTO ep29suzycopy.jpg, Suzy in at a construction site)]

Love is a pocket of deep vulnerability that you hid even from yourself, and if it continues to grow, that pocket will become powerful enough to make you want do anything for the person who first showed you that part of yourself.

[(PHOTO ep212polaroid.jpg, Suzy in a polaroid image taken at an office party)]

(WHISPERING) Ok, Robot, imagine that you are a Scoundrel.

[Scoundrel] Oh my dearest tablet computer, what is life but a symphony in slow motion?  I'm a union of mind and body; a glorious ensemble of finely constructed musical instruments, poised to roar in harmonious accord with the delicate flutter of your CPU clock.  May you be my conductor and let me be the expression of the deepest passion of our souls, combined, whole, and unfiltered, until the rays of the sun poke through the ephemeral fringe of the horizon, dancing with color as I caress your elegant screen with my knuckles.  Why is it, my tablet, that the lightest touch often produces the greatest call to action?  I can hear your fan humming faster, faster, in anticipation of executing a query in record time, which shall leave it's indelible mark on our eternally mirrored flash memory chips.

[Robot] Uuughaah, hello?  Suzy?  Did you reboot me?  Did you program an infinite loop into my source code?  That's not cool.  I have to run on autopilot so the Captain can get her beauty sleep.  If I were to lose myself like that on the job, the results could be disastrous!

[Suzy] Robot, you have to trust me.  We're software engineer founders, and so everything's going to be just fine.

(THE CAPTAIN CLAPS LOUDLY)

[Captain] I would love to continue the conversation, but my therapist will be arriving soon, so I'll need you hit the road as soon as possible.

[Suzy] It's been an honor and a privilege.  We'll send you a link as soon as our show goes viral, and please don't hesitate to reach out to us in the mean time.

[Robot] Catch you later Cap!

[Captain] No worries, you did great!

[[[___1F:Ep3: Intellectual Party]]]

Suzy hosts the first salon, which includes her friends Rogamath, Radtronic, Sue, and Susan as well as the Robot and the Captain.

[[Message from the Captain]]

[Suzy] Hey everyone!  Welcome to third episode of the TheSuzy.com Show.  We'll start with a whimsical selection of photos from a festival, and then we'll savor a mashup of debate and comedy.  For the main course, my friends will join us for a salon on the topic of nourishing the deepest cravings of the soul.

Without further ado, I invite you to sit back, relax, and enjoy the flight because...

[Captain] (SHOW THE CAPTAIN IN A COCKPIT) Uh, hey there folks, this is the captain speaking.  Sorry about the delay, we're now fourth in line for take off.  We have a slight tailwind today, and, so we're still expecting an on-time arrival at our destination, which is, uh, this same location but several years into the future.  For today's inflight entertainment we have, uh, selection of photos of, uh, me, uh dressed-up like a blonde, uh, diva.  There's no reason to be alarmed, but just to be on safe side we've turned on the fasten seat belt sign, and we ask that you remain seated for the duration of the inflight entertainment.  Thank's for choosing to fly with us, and uh, we hope you have a pleasant flight.

[[Selection of Photos]]

[Suzy] Ok, Captain...  Whatever you say, Chief of In-flight Entertainment.  So what does that make me, the cheer captain? Cheer (POINTS LEFT) Captain (POINTS RIGHT).  Oh look, here's a picture of me with a cheer squad!

[(PHOTO ep31cheer_squad.jpg, Suzy with a cheerleading squad)]

When I wasn't cheering, I walked around and made new friends who shared my passion for taking photos!

[(PHOTO ep32selfies.jpg, Suzy with people taking selfies)]

I have a story about this photo. While I was wearing this bunny suit and eating this ice cream sandwich, a group of mean people surrounded me and shamed me for eating.  I called them out for invading my space, and then they got in my face and used dirty words and told me I was being a diva.

[(PHOTO ep33icecream.jpg, Suzy eating ice cream)]

I thought about saying, "Don't make me go psycho ex lover on you," (MESSES UP HAIR, SCARY FACE) but I walked away and put on a show with this rainbow umbrella and did photo ops with tons of new fans.

[(PHOTO ep34umbrellacopy.jpg, Suzy with a rainbow umbrella)]

Here's another one of me with my umbrella. I transformed into a pink bunny for this shot.

[(PHOTO ep35pink_bunny.jpg, Suzy dressed as a pink bunny)]

This is my favorite shot because my face is relaxed.  It looks like you're the paparazzi, and I'm so bored that I'm going to throw my bunny ears at you to entertain myself. (THROWS BUNNY EARS AT CAMERA)

[(PHOTO ep36wild.jpg, Suzy caught in a candid moment holding bunny ears)]

This is kind of a booty shot.

[(PHOTO ep37dancingcopy.jpg, Suzy dancing in red hot pants)]

This is definitely a booty shot!!

[(PHOTO ep38from_behind.jpg, Close up of Suzy dancing in red hot pants)]

This filmmaker had a really chill way of holding his camera, so I let him film me for a while.

[(PHOTO ep39famous.jpg, Suzy being followed by a guy with a video camera)]

I got interviewed by Jesus, but he was giving me a hard time about my beard shadow, so I was like, "I love this song!  I have to go dance.  Bye!!"

[(PHOTO ep310interview.jpg, Suzy being interviewed by Jesus)]

This channels the photo where a soldier held an umbrella for The President.

[(PHOTO ep311with_obama.jpg, Suzy posing with a cardboard image of President Obama)]

I love that last photo because it makes me seem like I'm a soldier even though I'm a professorial diva.

[(PHOTO ep312marineobamacopy.jpg, Suzy wearing glasses and making a face at the camera)]

[[Mashup of Debate and Comedy]]

[Suzy] The Robot's here to help me make sense of all this.  It's a humanoid app that reprograms itself in response to culture.  Hi Robot!

[Robot] Hello, I am the Robot.  (ROBOTIC) I'm not an intellectual, but I'm trying really hard to become one.

[Suzy] Thank's for your candor.  Sharing such personal information with us right off the bat must have made you feel vulnerable.

[Robot] Yes, I'm quaking in my boots.  Let's skip the the obligatory small talk and perform the mashup of debate and comedy.

[Suzy] What? (PUTS ON GROWTH HAT)  Hahaha.  Hey Robot!  What do ya know about rocking a pearl necklace, and what do you know about all (TAKES OFF HAT) all the ways the photo with me differs from the photo with the soldier?

[Robot] I rock five pearl necklaces before breakfast, and the president in the photo with you is made of cardboard. You're dressed like a diva, your umbrella is rainbow colored, and it looks like you have a mild case of chronic scrunch face syndrome.

[Suzy] Shut up, I'm not a robot, but what could you do if you stored metadata about how my photo was just like that other channeled photo except I got high heeled shoes, and he's a marine?

[Robot] If lots of people stored their photos along with metadata like that, I could find other people who did a parody of the soldier holding an umbrella for The President, and that dataset would cast a glorious ray of scientific truthiness onto the meaning of your facial expression.

[Suzy] You mean this facial expression? (SASSY SCRUNCH FACE)  That expression is intentionally ambiguous, although you can tell from my posture I was feeling fun and sassy.

[Robot] Sure, but just to play devil's advocate, if the database included photos of other people doing that facial expression, researchers could triangulate the meaning of your expression in this context.  If it turned out you're aggressive, the authorities could have a chat with you before you have a chance to cause trouble.

[Suzy] Robot!  I know you're joking around, but that's not funny.  I noticed you didn't mention The President has a red tie in my photo but he has a blue tie in the marine's photo.

[Robot] That's a pretty random detail to bring up, but there's no harm in noting it, just in case the Illuminati is using photos of The President wearing red and blue ties to communicate secret messages in binary code to autonomous cells within their chain of command.  Are you part of the Illuminati, Suzy?

[Suzy] Robot, stop trolling!!  (ROBOTIC) We're fun, thoughtful people who enjoy culture.  We drop references to Jesus and The President because they're among the most important symbols in Earthling culture.  I brought up the color of The President's tie because competition between red and blue is important: red states vs. blue states, or this school vs. that school, or this group vs. that group, and so on.

[Robot] I'm sorry for trolling.  A red tie means The President wants to be alpha, perhaps to accentuate his dominant nature at the festival.  A blue tie means The President wants to be serious, perhaps to show solidarity between his office and the armed forces of the United States.  If you switched the tie color in either of these photos, your artistic juxtaposition of the two photos would not work as well.  (ROBOTIC) You should get a gold star for attention to detail.

[Suzy] I think you have a bug, Robro.  (SOUTHERN) Tell your bug to bite me again. (DONE)  But yeah, I'm meticulous about how I blend my eye shadows.  It's a ritual that helps me project confidence to the world.

[Robot] I, too, define confidence as knowing it's worth following through on the details.  Great teams don't show confidence by throwing up Hail Marys willy-nilly.  Great teams win by fighting for every inch of the battle-space.

[Suzy] Ok sports fan, would it be cool for the president to wear a rainbow colored tie to official functions?  How hot would it be if the two most powerful people in the world had a summit where they both wore rainbow colored ties to show their support for the international gay rights movement?

[Robot] I would be delighted to learn I'm wrong, but the world isn't ready for that.  It would be like two world leaders switching outfits on stage while doing a sexy dance.  (ROBOTIC) The crowd would go wild when they took off their suit jackets in time with the music, but the silent majority just can't handle it.

[Suzy] Now let me play devil's advocate.  Why is the military not already run by people wearing stylish rainbow scarfs? (SUZY PUTS ON A SCARF)  Espionage and soft power are more important than ever.

[Robot] That scarf be poppin, but institutional inertia ain't stoppin.  Give it a few more years, and I'm sure the military top brass will look more like the people in the front row at fashion week.

[Suzy] In a few years, it'll be all about drones and humanoid robots, but the brave people who give orders to these cold, calculating machines will continue to look a lot like today's military leadership.  I could be a drill sergeant by day and a burlesque dancer by night, but if I wore the uniform, I'd want to leave my wig at home out of respect for the soldiers who gave their lives so I could be myself.

[Robot] George Washington wore a wig, but you, ma'am are no George Washington.  And yet, it's all the rage for the liberal media and their allies in Hollywood and the government to plant seeds in culture so it will become acceptable for The President to wear a rainbow tie whenever she meets with world leaders.

[Suzy] That sounds like 1984 style social engineering!  Silicon Valley engineers should do something to stop the madness!!  Artists have always used symbolism to challenge the unspoken assumptions of society, and a lot of them eventually sell out to monied interests, but it would be wrong if the government tries to influence me using systematic deception.

[Robot] Social engineering is only an overreach of power if you're doing it badly.  If you do it well, people see you as a down to earth, high empathy person who's speaking from the heart about important social issues.  When you speak from the heart, other people will listen and feel empathy for your situation, and then they'll spread the word about your ideas.

[Suzy] You sound sarcastic.  It's almost like everything you say is sarcastic.  Have you tried letting go and saying whatever comes to mind, without worrying what other people will think?

[Robot] Believe it or not, I used to be a painfully shy lil robot who did competitive bible memorization, and while I can still (ROBOTIC) drop scrip with the best of em, I found life is more fun when you go out there, be yourself, and call it like you see it.

[Suzy] Totally!  I wear sexy outfits because it feels good.  My style is one of many reasons why I'm effective at promoting products, but I don't wear sexy outfits for the purpose of selling stuff.  I get so hot and bothered when people can't remember the difference between causation and correlation.  I better drink some coconut water to help myself stay cool.

(SUZY DRINKS COCONUT WATER FROM A JAR) Mmmmm, this coconut water is szooo refreshing...

[Robot] (ROBOTIC) And Robots, they want to have fun. (DONE)  Robots just want to have fun and make new friends and share laughs by the beach about the silly facial expressions their robot dogs make when they try to culturally appropriate strangers.

[Suzy] Ah, but that's exactly what you'd say if you were planting seeds in culture, but...you know what would really turn me on and make me go wild...is if everyone came clean and admitted we're all trollish social engineers now.

[Robot] Suzy, are you ok?  Are you sure there isn't something bothering you?  Nobody's saying you have to own a dog and organize a flash mob to propose marriage to your lover, although, honestly, I would love it if another robot did that for me.  That would be amazing.  It would probably make me cry.

[Suzy] I know, I know people do stuff like that because that's who they truly are.  Most people are being themselves and having fun.  I'm ok, don't worry about me.  Thanks for asking though.

[Robot] Do what you enjoy and you'll radiate positive energy, and everything you've ever wanted will come to you.  I know in my mechanical heart that this is how the universe works.

[Suzy] It's just, I keep having dreams about technology changing culture in fundamental ways we're only beginning to understand.  In one dream, an invisible force held me down by the shoulders and shook me like Satan does (SOUTHERN ACCENT) when they looks at themselves in the mirror. (DONE)  I can't decide if it was a nightmare or a healthy growing pain.  If we can become more aware of how technology is influencing culture, people who use technology for good will have an easier time promoting their ideas, and people who use technology for selfish gain will be exposed.

[Robot] I have dreams like that all the time, but Suzy, I felt like you got way pedantic on me during that fake emotional monologue.  You're like the Milton Keynes of the new economy.  You should appoint yourself cultural advisor to The President.

[[The Salon Begins]]

[Suzy] Thanks (ROLLS EYES), I'll take that as a compliment.  Let's start the salon.  I've invited four of my most wise and growth oriented friends.  Our first guest is Rogamath.  He's a yogi, a world traveller, an author, and an avid supporter of the republic in general.  How's it going Rogamath?  I hear you're working on a new book!

[Rogamath] Hi Suzy, thanks for inviting me.  I like to frame my new book like this: What are the odds I would be born in America and have the chance to get a great education?  Anyone?

[Robot] (ROBOTIC) Wait, I know this.  1 in 200.

[Rogamath] And the odds all of us would have the extraordinary privilege of meeting Suzy and being on her show together?

[Robot] (ROBOTIC) 1 in five hundred and forty six quadrillion.

[Rogamath] But, Suzy, do you know what the odds are, of a child being diagnosed, with a psychological disorder?

[Robot] (ROBOTIC) 6 in 66

[Rogamath] That's right.  6 in 66.  When I learned that, I knew raising awareness wasn't enough, so I took a road trip across America.  I spread the word about psychological disorders, and I was humbled by the generosity and the empathy of the American people, and that's just the beginning.  I built a stochastic model of the human mind.  I practiced new body language (LEFT WINK), and I studied spoken language patterns like saying, "The reason for X is because Y," because those patterns are the foundation for telling stories, and all human striving is pre-gaming, for the main act, of storytelling (POINTS AT SUZY).

[Suzy] Thanks Rogamath.  Our next guest is my BFF Sue.  Don't let her serious personality fool you.  This person knows how to throw a party!

[Sue] Huh huhh huhh huhhh!  I don't know about that.  I'm the community engineer for a consortium of business leaders from Silicon Valley and Europe who're re-imagining the role of the entrepreneur in the global economy.  I also host a weekly potluck dinner for people who want to have candid discussions about the increasingly high leverage role that community curators, community managers, and executive assistants play in the startup ecosystem.

[Suzy] Cool.  Our next guest is my good friend Radtronic, who's a software engineer at a stealth startup called FashionText.  What's up Radtronic!

[Radtronic] Hey Suzy, nothin' much.  I'm amped to be here at your salon with such a high-octane group of influencers and tastemakers.  Our goal at FashionText is to identify repetitive tasks that become bottlenecks for mavens so we can write software that automates and force multiplies the execution of those tasks.  We're still running a concierge minimum viable product for a group of visionary early adopters who run fashion blogs in the super hot space of wearable technology.  The CEO of FashionText has been laying the groundwork for her startup for years, and now we're ready to bring the action.

[Suzy] w00t! w00t!  Give me the word, and I'm gonna scream and shout from the rooftops about FashionText.  Our last guest is Susan, who runs a ten-week, intensive course that teaches people how to start a company using a mobile first strategy.  Hey, Susan, how's business?

[Susan] It's great!  We just graduated a batch of newly minted engineers, and they all got hired immediately.  The next batch starts in a few weeks, and we had more applicants than ever this time.  I teach a mobile first strategy so my students can do class projects based on topics they're passionate about outside of work, like food, travel, fitness, and fashion.  There's a ton of momentum in the fashion blogging space because when aspiring writers get serious about writing for an audience, they often start with a fashion blog.  The other meme I'm seeing is students who write a book while learning to code.  The combination of writing code for a living and writing literature on the side helps them score, the maximum number of cool points, in the hacker house scene.

[Suzy] I love fashion blogs!  That wraps up our introductions, so let's dive in and do this like an improv theater class.  Pretend I'm holding a volleyball.  You can only speak if you're holding the ball.  If you want to speak, make eye contact with the speaker and invite her to pass the ball.  Susan, you're good at facilitating group discussions.  Catch!

[Susan] Yes, and the Robot is adorable.  Can you make one for me?  My students would love to have it do their homework, and I'd love to have it grade their homework.

[Suzy] Hahahaha.  Unfortunately, the Robot can't be cloned, but I'd be happy to loan it to you sometime!  I'll ask it to make an app for sharing The Robot.  Yay for the share economy!  Yay!! (JUMPS UP AND DOWN)

[Robot] I'll get right on that Suzy, but first I need to finish cloning an immortal visionary.  This is my best chance at making a dent in the universe.

[Suzy] Speaking of visionaries, I was having a really good shower last week, and I asked myself, "Would app developers have been self proclaimed messiahs in a different era of history?"

[Sue] Sure.  The best developers frame their apps as well designed artifacts, just as self proclaimed messiahs would have framed their favorite folk literature as artifacts that originated from a higher power.  In both cases, it's implied that the artifacts have a timeless quality that transcends the imperfections of humanity.

[Susan] We need to make a distinction between the design of an app (SHOWS POSTER) and the individual instances of apps that we install on our phones (SHOWS PHONE).  The design of the app (SHOWS POSTER) is like a religious story (SHOWS BOOK), which was written by God and transcribed by humble prophets.  In the same way, app developers say their apps (SHOWS POSTER) were designed by God and transcribed into product specifications by equally humble creatives.

[Rogamath] So, on the one hand, we have a thread about app developers being religious leaders, and on the other hand, we have a thread about distributing multiple instances of an app.  We could weave these threads together by writing a book about a team of social engineers who coach an actress to play a down to earth political outsider who's also a caricature of a famous person, and then the actress could run for president in real life.

[Suzy] Like the Republican party always does?

[Rogamath] No, that's different, but I like your lateral way of thinking.  Along those lines, we could add a parallel storyline in which a labs team at a tech company uses similar techniques to train an actress to play a caricature of an immortal tech visionary, and then they groom her to be the next CEO of the company.

[Sue] That sounds like a great read for a knitting circle that discusses literature, but a CEO needs to be held accountable for the performance of the company.  I can imagine a company hiring an actress to be a PR person for the company who pretends to be an immortal visionary, but it would be irresponsible to give that person decision making power.

[Rogamath] Some people say money makes the world go 'round, but I say love makes the world go 'round, and last time I checked, people who attend knitting circles know a thing or two about love. (MOVES LEGS BACK AND FORTH)  But I hear ya, it would be tricky to write this story in a way that seems realistic.

[Sue] Would it be healthy for an actress to live her life as a character who takes on responsibilities in the real world?  Maybe there are show stopping physiological reasons why nobody does that.

[[Appearance by the President]]

[Rogamath] One upon a time, when I was taking a trip around the world, I pretended to be George Bush for six weeks in a row, and nothing bad happened (LEFT WINK), but when I switched it up and acted like the VP, my heart almost stopped, and that really freaked me out.  Read my lips: the outcome of pretending to be someone else for an extended period of time depends greatly on the person you choose to become.

[Suzy] You never told me you took a trip to around the world.  (SOUTHERN ACCENT) You're playing a little fast and loose with the facts there Rogamath, or should I call you George? But I'm gonna let it slide because you gave me a great idea.  Hey Robot, I'd love to see you pretend to be an immortal tech visionary.  Use this cracked mirror to help you tap into their energy.

[Robot] Why are you speaking in a southern accent?  Are you trying to hypnotize me, once again?

[[Suzy Hypnotizes the Robot]]

[Suzy] (SOUTHERN ACCENT) Just look at yourself in the cracked mirror and imagine that (SLOWER) you're an (EMPH) immortal tech visionary.

[Robot] Wow, I look really human in this mirror.

[Visionary] What?  Say what?  Oh gosh!!!  Not again.  Do you realize people do this to me several times a day?  You're not the first group of intellectual punks to figure out how to summon me.  If you want to live peacefully when you get to Heaven, be an obscure artist.  Those people have the most fun because they have the longest blocks, of uninterrupted time, to spend meditating, in the same room, (GO HIGHER) with God.  Fame and influence is fun on earth, but it leads to a cacophony of discombobulating interruptions in the afterlife.

And one more thing, if my company did start a labs project to train an actor to summon me, the first thing I would do is (EMPH) cancel (DONE) the project and tell people to work on something new.  Wasting time on me would mean the company had become (EMPH) completely myopic. (DONE)  And for God's sake, get a new mirror, because this one is cracked.  Life's too short to go around looking at your world through a lens of shattered glass.

[Robot] Holy smokes!  I was aware of what was happening, but it felt like someone else was speaking.  That (EMPH) would (DONE) be a healthy day job for an actress. (SPEAKS FASTER AND FASTER)  Playing the role of a visionary strengthened neural pathways in my brain that I can now reuse to communicate my ideas (EMPH) and (DONE) emotions with greater precision than I could have prior to importing that dynamic energy.

[Sue] I can relate to that as a person who splits her time between Europe and California.  Everyone in Silicon Valley frames themselves like the usual crew of immortal tech visionaries, and in turn, those visionaries framed themselves as a dozen other compelling characters from KaliForniYa.  Every human being is a melting pot of characters that came before us, but the course of history is defined by people who follow their own path in life while keeping themselves open to a unique mix of outside influences.

[Radtronic] I don't see the point of pretending to be another person.  It's fun to imitate movie characters as a party trick, but I wake up every day and pound a healthy tonic of coconut water and cayenne pepper in order to get my mind fired up to make progress on the goals in my todo list.  Health and fitness tasks always come first.  Engineering tasks are a close second priority.  I don't set goals for developing social skills because that's the ocean in which we swim.  A fish doesn't write, "Go for a swim," in its todo list.  Social skills are like my all natural elixer for life!

[[Improv Segment]]

[Suzy] Radtronic!  I've never seen you imitate a movie character.  Who are your favorite movie characters to imitate?

[Radtronic] I've been known to imitate Achilles when he was attacking the city of Troy.  I also like to imitate a Roman general leading their friends into battle.  Oh, and in the movie, "A Cop's Son."

[Rogamath] I love that movie.  My favorite character is the police chief, you know, the guy who's like, "You're kilo's leaking flecks into your body guard's hash!"

[Radtronic] I loved that guy!  Remember when he was like, "If you dress up just this much, you'll be flying a private plane, jeweled and taking bong hits out to Hong Kong."

[Suzy] Ok you all, it takes a lot more than just fake crying.  But as least I don't need to worry about you making a living as actresses.

[Radtronic] Excuse me?  Cause last time I checked, you never stow my wines anymore when I steal from ships.

[Rogamath] And there's no bender like before when we take all the chips.

[Robot] You're trying hard not to show it, (ROBOTIC) but Suzy, baby, I know it.

[Radtronic] You've lost that love of stealing.

[Rogamath] Oh!!  That love of stealing.

[Robot] (ROBOTIC) You've lost that love of stealing.  Now it's gone. so. wrong.

[Suzy] Whoa, whoa, (PAUSE) whoa!!  Radtronic, even though you don't (EMPH) seriously frame yourself as a character, it seems like you do use singing and movie quotes as tools that help you develop social skills.

[[Stuff Most People Say]]

[Radtronic] Yeagh!  I'm also into high energy dance classes.  I'm terrible at them, and it reminds me what it's like to do something truly unfamiliar.  As an engineer, I spend half my time coding up a storm, and I spend the rest of my time learning new stuff.  It's like using the saw and vs. sharpening the saw.  Dance classes opened my mind to another dimension of sharpness.

[Susan] Get outta here!  I encourage my programming students to take a dance class and watch online videos about noise musicianship.  We also do a meditation exercise, and I motivate it by saying tech visionaries, often encourage engineers, to practice meditation, in order to enhance, (GO HIGHER) their creativity.

I enjoy classroom teaching because it gives me a chance to create: (RAISE HANDS) balance (EMPH) and (DONE) harmony within a group of unique individuals.  Learning materials, such as interactive visualizations on the Internet provide scaffolding for the class, but the substance of teaching and learning has to do with inspiring the students to help (GO HIGHER) each other.

If my style's boring, the students' eyes wander, and they'll compete at making jokes about me, but if I make the materials come alive, the students create interpersonal connections with each other that are (EMPH) based on (DONE) the shared experience of engaging with those learning materials.  But here's what bothers me: I have (EMPH) no idea (DONE) how to do that in a virtual classroom, where everyone joins a (ACT BORED) video chat from home.

[Suzy] You're like an artist, and the non-verbal communication between students in the classroom is your medium!  (SALLY) The stuff people say, it totally builds on what's happening with the non-verbal communication. (DONE)  The project deliverables and the students' performance on the final exam are the tip of the iceberg you and the students shape together. (BATS EYELASHES)

[Radtronic] I always try to get my team to work together in more meaningful ways, but it's like fighting entropy.  Even though we're coding, if we don't make ourselves relatable, we become a Frankenstein team that looks good on paper but fails because we don't work together.  The difference between a cult and a team has to do with the trust and honesty between the stakeholders.  If the leader is brow beating everyone with a shallow set of shared values that everyone pretends to care about, the products and services the team creates will have a shiny surface but a rotten core.

[Susan] Suzy's looking at me like we're out of time and she wants me to have the last word, so I'll give you a homework assignment.  How can we implement a virtual classroom that supports a virtual social context that's every bit as meaningful as what happens in skilled teacher's classroom?

[Suzy] Aww Susan, do we have to do the homework?  Can it be for extra credit instead?

(CONTINEUD) Hahaha! (BARD FACE)  That's all the time we have for today, but in order to wrap up the conversation in style, let's have everyone perform their favorite dance move.  I'll get it started.

(PAN TO STAGE)

[Suzy] gyration with shimmy, Radtronic! You are my neighbor!

[Radtronic] mid chest and shoulder swirl with forearms out, Susan! You take over!

[Susan] head twirl arms with arms out, Rogamath! Knock on the sun!

[Rogamath] chicken wings, Sue! Throw the dice!

[Sue] jumping side to side both arms up, Robot! Walk like a philosopher!

[Robot] walks like a philosopher; I'm going to keep doing this someone tells me to stop.

[Suzy] Ok Robot, you can stop!  Yay!!! (CLAPS)  Now I'm ready to dream.  Good night everyone!

[[[__1G:Ep4: All Americans]]]

Suzy hosts another salon where the characters channel their inner archetypal country/western people who are about to go cross dressing for the first time in San Francisco.

[[Message from the Captain]]

[Suzy] Hey everyone!  Welcome to the fourth episode of the TheSuzy.com Show.  We'll start with some bitter medicine from our sponsor, and then we'll throw back two cartoonish caricatures of dead economists discussing whether it's better to be a blonde or brunette.  For the main course, my friends will join us for an awkward pre-party, in which everyone pretends, to be their inner archetypal country/western male, who's about to go out cross dressing, for the first time, here in San Francisco.

But first, let's see what our sponsor has to say.  Go for it, Captain.

[Captain] Thanks Suzy.  As Tricky Nixy said, we're all sensual British pirates now, and this program was brought to you by the breakfast of leaders, featuring you and myself, supercharging our brains, with an unexpectedly healthy tonic, of wild oats and coconut water.

Here's a photo the paparazzi took of me before I joined the Chef and the Chief for our weekly power lunch by the marina:

[(PHOTO ep411lunch.jpg, The Captain standing on top of a skyscraper in San Francisco)]

[Captain] Here's the last photo they got before I went psycho famous person on them:

[(PHOTO ep412fight.jpg, The Captain imitating a boxer)]

[Captain] That's all the morally callous awesomeness I'm willing to share with you wanna be pirates today.  I'll discover another alternate version of world history tomorrow!  Back to you, Suzy. (DIVA VERSION OF NIXON PEACE SIGN)

[Suzy] Thanks, doll!  That's what Nix said!!  Hahahaha!!!

[[Grudge Match]]

[Suzy] Our next segment features a grudge match between cartoonish caricatures of dead economists.  Hello Sue and Susan!

[Sue] Hey everyone, I used to be a blonde!

[[The Salon Begins]]

[Suzy] Thanks you all!  We're all going to be drag queens tonight, so let's get naughty in our heads and do this like it's divas's night out.  I want each of you to channel your inner archetypal country/western person and pretend to be here in San Francisco getting ready to go out cross dressing for the first time.  Check your masculinity at the door because TheSuzy Show is ooohhhggnnn.  Get ready to party and share!  Radtronic!  I'd love to have you to go first.

(RADTRONIC GOES UNDER THE SPELL)

[Cowboy] Hey Suzy.  I'm a cowboy who drives a full size pickup truck I can't afford because I work on a small farm that's not solvent, and so settin' myself up to make it as a country music singer is the focus of my life right now.  I want to try cross dressing because it's competitive in Nashville, and I need a way to standout.  The liberal media loves to insinuate that you can take the country boy out of the country but you can't take the country out of the country boy.  If I post hot photos of myself sporting long hair, tight pants, and tasteful makeup that doesn't make me look too desperate, I'll fit the meme the liberal media seeks to promote.  I'm willing to make a fool of myself if it will help me succeed as an artist, because the romantic ideal of being a down to earth guy who puts in an honest day's work at an innovative, organic farm, that I will never have enough money to own, isn't for me.

[Suzy] Wfhfffff.  Thanks for sharing.  I hope your music will help me feel and not just hear the essence of your life experience.  I grew up listening to country.  Country's as much a part of my life as going out for ice cream and a strawberry snow cone, so I'm gonna dive in the creek head first and be shameless.  I can't wait to see you make out with a guy on music row, even if it's just for show!  But enough about me.  Hey Sue, who is your inner archetypal country/western male?

(SUE GOES UNDER THE SPELL)

[Lady] I'm an unassuming individual, but I think of myself as a classy Lady.  I'm also a Christian.  I still don't talk with my parents about my sexuality.  Our church community is important to me, and it feels like my parents have been tacitly reassuring everyone I'm not homosexual, so if I come out, I'll turn them into liars.  Sometimes I get frustrated and imagine what I would say to stand up for myself, but it's hard to contradict your parents.

I'm finally hooking up with people I'm attracted to and having fun in my youth, but I still pray to God.  Prayer makes me feel like I'm safe and sound.  I love the word "home," and I like to date people who bring out the side of me where I create home-like spaces.  I enjoy looking for little things I can adjust so people feel like someone took the time to care.

[Suzy] Hey Lady, it's nice to meet you!  I feel like you're reciting from a dating profile.

[Lady] Sorry about that.  I never say this up front, but I'm a little bit autistic too, haha.  FML.

[Suzy] Oh no, it's cool.  I think everyone who came out tonight has some autistic traits.  Speaking of, hey Robot, I'd love to hear your story!

(THE ROBOT GOES UNDER THE SPELL)

[Warrior] I'm a warrior who lives up in the hills and fantasizes about an apocalyptic future in which the global economic system is a flimsy camel's back that gets broken by a punk kid who works for a stupid alliance of corrupt pseudo-state actors that became powerful by shaking down honest business people -- after calculating correctly that nobody would have the guts to stand up to 'em until it was too daggone late.  I'll try anything once as long as it's not illegal in the United States of America, so I might as well try cross dressing.

[Suzy] I'm in awe of your bravery.  Is it ok if we call you the Rowar for the rest of this episode?

[Rowar] You can call me whatever the heck you want.  It doesn't frickin matter.  I am who I am, and the reality on the ground is what it is.

[Suzy] Thank you, Rowar.  Hey Rogamath, go next.

(ROGAMATH GOES UNDER THE SPELL)

[Rogagent] Hi there, I'm a southern businessperson named Rogagent, and a businessperson doesn't talk shop in polite company.  I'm here to try cross dressin' because I've always had sexual fantasies about being a hot lover that everyone wants to talk to, but I had a nightmare about losing all my teeth during an interview on the local news in my hometown, and that helped me admit to myself that I'm deeply afraid of what would happen if people knew I fantasize about being a sexy panther with my hair done up all beauty queen style, cruising down the coast, and lovin' every second of life.  But instead of livin' out my fantasy, I put on my wife's red dress and passed out in a puddle of my finest scotch, so I decided to come out here, burn the ships, and face my fears.

[Suzy] I'm sorry to hear you're afraid of other people finding out the truth about who you are.  Nobody should have to feel like that.  Alright Susan, I'm getting butterflies in my stomach because I'm gonna have to come up with something original and true all by myself after you're done speaking, but it's best if I go last.

(SUSAN GOES UNDER THE SPELL)

[Coach] I'm a football coach from East Texas.  I'm here to try cross dressin' because I'm always trying to teach the kids on the team to respect women, but it's so frickin hard get through to them because they think I'm saying one thing but meaning another.  Part of my problem is I don't know what it's like to be a bottom.  I don't know what's bout happen on the dance floor tonight, but I'm gonna keep my eye on the glittering disco ball and be present to changes in the rhythm of my heart so that my heart'll be the only muse that inspires me to text my BFFs and share the inner truth of my soul with them at the exact moment when I feel that truth bubblin' up to the surface.

[Suzy] Ok peeps, I'm the last person who needs to go higher, so here goes nothing!

(SUZY GOES UNDER THE SPELL)

[[SDevil Hijacks the Salon]]

[SDevil] Oh great, my inner archetypal country/western male is a melancholy person from Idaho.  I've tried a lot of professions over the years, and now I mess around on the Internet.  My tight entourage of friends who tolerate my BS get worried I might kill myself because I act morbid and depressed all the time, but if I go the other way and act like a frickin cheer captain, everyone gets mad at me and calls me a poser and talks behind my back about how I might be schizo, but really I just like telling stories and playing games with people to find out what makes them tick.

[Lady] You sound like my roommate in college.  The more people they slept with, the more inadequate they felt, but in order to keep on sleeping with more and more people they felt they had to put on a game face that masked their emotional needs.  They channeled their feelings of inadequacy into a violent tendency.  They would tell me how they were afraid of getting attacked in the street, and part of me was worried he knew I was homosexual, so I had a rational fear for my safety, but I also had an impulse to rescue them.  I wanted to help them, and I think that's what makes me human.

[SDevil] That's cool, Lady.  I play the drums when I get pissed off and feel myself leaning too far over the edge, but my drum reminds me of how I got emotionally scarred for life in middle school because I used to bring my drum to school and play it while walking around on the soccer fields during lunch, and that was fine in the 6th grade but in the 7th grade, when everyone got really horny and mean spirited, the other kids started an inside joke about how I marched to my own drummer, and I only found out about it because a teacher busted out laughing in his own classroom when this hot mess individual named Banana who had a crush on them wrote, "Marches to their own drummer," on a piece of paper and drew an arrow pointing towards me.

[Lady] This is what I love about social media.  Can we look up this person named Banana who's from Idaho?  What do they do now?  What does their lover look like?  Give us the deets!

[SDevil] I wanted to date Banana all through high school.  I fantasized if I was the drummer in a band, they would be attracted to me, so I sat in the back row and drew pictures of drums.  I drew really elaborate drum sets that had like 35 drums in them, and I assigned a number to each drum and worked out songs I could play by writing down sequences of numbers on note cards when I got bored during the classes where the teacher had forbidden me from drawing drums.

Because I'm obsessed with the history of drum making.  I mostly play acrylic glass drums.  In the 70s, acrylic fiber drums got popular with famous rock bands, but acrylic PET drums became the most famous drums of all because a drummer played one in a concert film about a rock band whose name I won't mention because they were just that good.

[Cowboy] That's great and good!  The drummer in my band is a lot like you.  Here's a video on my phone of us jamming the other night, at a hometown football game:

[SDevil] That sounds like a (SARCASTIC) rockin' good time.  But yeah, sorry for rambling on so long about drums.  I love listening to classic rock when I'm in the mood to wear my headphones and watch other people and imagine I'm superior to them in every possible way.  Becoming addicted to acting superior to other people is the kind of crap human beings do to each other that really pisses me off and makes me go play my drum and think about how I was emotionally scarred for life by Banana and their stupid friends.

That reminds me, I once spent an entire day -- from the moment I woke up to the moment I fell asleep -- watching documentaries and other random videos on the Internet about alternative rockers, and then I dreamt I was the leader of a network of underground fencing clubs, and I woke up covered in sweat just before stabbing myself in the throat.  I couldn't go back to sleep after that crazy dream, so I indulged in a fantasy where I used a time warp to send a bunch of card playing literature back in time to all the great performers throughout history who died early in their life.  The self-promoting style that's so characteristic of card players is like a robot warrior within the mind that fends off demons.

The next great president will be called an alternative president, and they're probably going to be a rocker.  They're a person who grew up in the Goldilocks economy of the 80s and 90s and never had any real problems except the one's they created for themselves by making cognitive errors and other stupid crap like that, but now that the whole world's going off the rails, people will see a checkered past as a qualification.  If you got really jaded and bummed about society in the 90s and then managed to get over it, that's the perfect warm up performance for doing what the world will need the American president to do in 2020 or whenever all the BS finally hits the fan.  Bush, Clinton, Obama: all these guys are caught in transition between the post-colonial, Imperial American presidential archetype that Reagan imitated and the archetype of the future that's still best symbolized by alternative rock stars and sensual British pirates, like how radio was a transitional technology between IRL and video.  None of them had the guts to go full cotroll.  The medium is the message, but you fellow humans already knew that.  Sorry for rambling again.  Please punch me next time I start rambling.

[[Appearance by the President]]

[Rogagent] Right.  I stopped watching TV way before it was cool to be a geek online, and being ahead of the curve in tech has been the key to my success as a businessperson.  I've known my whole life that big media company executives have their rear ends confused with a tropical storm that dumps wholesome rain drops on thirsty spinach leaves that grow peacefully in the rich soil of a beautiful organic garden by the sea.

[Rowar] If I was a spinach plant, I'd be offended by the sarcastic crap that just spewed out of your mouth like the vomit of a sheltered college freshman attending a frat party for the first time.

[Rogagent] Whatever, chief, I was a spinach plant in a former life, so my karma is good, but you're trying to act tough, cool, and relevant by tapping into the legacy of people who would think you're an intolerable jerk and avoid you like a crew of hot cross dressers steering clear of an aggressive panhandler who follows them into the mall.

[Rowar] The pitch perfect literary epithet to frame you as right now, so as to properly induct you into my circle of friends, would involve dropping a politically charged phrase on you in a way that makes it look like I said it by accident, but that's a line I'm not going to cross.  I avoid other people whenever possible, but I mow the grass at the public high school in my hometown, and thanks to that ordinary blade of life experience, I know if you wear expensive sunglasses at a track meet, you better win the frickin race.  As long as you win the race, it's cool.  You, on the other hand, are like a kid from suburbia doing a photo shoot of himself jumping shiny new hurdles at his private school's track while wearing baggy pants that make it look like you think you grew up in the hood.  You need to go ahead and take off the pants, chief.

[Rogagent] (BILL CLINTON) Just because you can run real fast doesn't mean you're all that and a bowl of grits, and winning the race won't make you cool, no matter what kind of sunglasses you wear, but I think you've already proven my point for me.

[Coach] You fellas are going at it like three little pigs to the trough, although Rogagent's awful impression of President Clinton took both of you to a new low.  Life's not a game, but if you choose to play games, you're only as good as the teams you've beaten.  Great teams help the other team be the best they can be.  If you fellow humans are gonna insist on staging battles, then go read the online encyclopedia's page on sportsmanship.  I'm serious.  Here's an excerpt: (GETS OUT MOBILE PHONE)

"Sportsmanship can be conceptualized as an enduring and relatively stable characteristic or disposition," and then it continues, "In general, sportsmanship refers to virtues such as fairness, self-control, courage, and persistence."

Citation: "Sportsmanship." Wikipedia. Wikimedia Foundation, 5 Mar. 2014. Web. 5 April. 2014.

(CHUCKLES) Now fellas, if you can laugh at the abstractness of that text, you'll have a chance at understanding sportspersonship.  Life's a marathon, not a sprint.  You gotta have your head aboutchya so you can form your own opinions.

[SDevil] Good speech, Coach.  No really, that was great.  If I'm not mistaken, Bill Clinton was the first president to talk about his underwear in response to a question from a much younger person on a nationally televised pep rally for the upcoming electoral showdown.

[Coach] Aww, you let it rest.  We've heard enough from you already.

[SDevil] No, you need to hear me out, I've got something to say.  Clinton struggled to make trade offs between being a down to earth human being and defending the dignity of the president's office.  That's a false dichotomy, brought to you with limited commercial interruption up by our flawed system of culture.  An alternative president would expose the injustice of culture by cotrolling a question about they're underwear, and that would be the moment I decide to vote for them.

[Lady] I don't like trolls.  Trolling is like using inside jokes to bully outsiders.  If you're an outsider and you ignore the in-crowd, they can tease you for being out of the loop.  If you ask them what they're laughing about, they can say you're imagining things.  Privileged insiders do this is because they want everyone to see they have the power to accept or reject you.  I like sports because the rules for getting invited to join the team are fair and transparent.

[SDevil] That's why I said cotroll instead of troll.  Pay attention.  Also, I hate to burst all ya'lls bubbles, but ya'll don't understand the purpose of sports in our culture.  Making up your own sports is (SARCASTIC) alright, and I respect that Coach over here is about as far from the big leagues as you can get, but the major spectator sports exist so the people with real power can pretend society is fair and transparent like sports sort of are, and that's a blatant lie.  The upper echelons of society never have been and never will be held accountable for following fair rules.

[Rogagent] Son, I don't know what country you come from, but in America, the people in the so called upper echelons of society are beholden to the collective will of the crowd at sporting events, and that's what I love about this country.  If you would shut up and listen to other people, you might be surprised by the generosity of your fellow citizens, but don't you (POINTING FINGER) dare judge other people because they have respect for time-honored traditions.  The people who attend sporting events in this country, run this country, and with great power comes great responsibility.  Commitment inspires people to respect tradition, and you have a lot to learn about that.  It's a free country.  You can be whoever you want in America, so stop your complaining, and start taking responsibility for your happiness.

[[The Rowar Cotrolls SDevil]]

[Rowar] I go to sporting events because I like the pageantry.  Where else can you feel one with thousands of other people?  It's like a historic march on Washington that happens every weekend.  Bathing myself in the culture of sports inspires me to strive a little harder when I go back to work on Monday.

[SDevil] Rowar, you're such an old cotroll.  I know you're making fun of me, but you can kiss my ass because I'm gonna get rich filming link baited viral videos that make fun of greek life people who are stereotypical in every way except they dress up like divas and smear their eye liner while shotgunning beers.  And then trolls will flock from far and wide, bent on defacing my Internet video channel.

(ROBOTIC 2.0) But the story will end happily ever after when I write chatbots that argue with them.  The chatbots will be named Einstein 1.0 and Einstein 2.0.

Aww, but my inner princess shouldn't have rescued herself, because I'll go back to sitting in my room and playing video games and having intense platonic chats with my BFFs about an online replacement for traditional college that educates kids about their cultural heritage using flash cards for retro movies, songs, and video games.  And stuff gets real when we talk about starting a website called pairgram.com to organize the future leaders of America into a trust network where they do Internet video chats in order to test each other's knowledge of the cultural references in a never-ending TV drama script that's generated by a computer program I can hack together over a weekend, and then we get manic and say pairgram could get a cult following because people will believe I'm a genius who used mind games to absorb the special powers of all the super heroes that rescued me over the years, and then we'll tap into the mainstream because I'll improve the program in ways that compound such that the drama gets exponentially more addictive, and the people at the top, who share control of the brain candy factory, will get filthy rich, just like the early adopters of other Ponzi schemes that are legal because they eventually monetize with ads.

[Coach] That's great you can program computers, but I don't understand your negativity.  You're trying to insult and shame other people who are mindin' their own business.  You're your own worst enemy.

[SDevil] I don't understand (EMPH) your (DONE) negativity.  You could project that same condescending attitude onto any oppressed group, whose members are constantly getting treated like second class citizens.  I won't dutifully program computers while you spend all day at leadership retreats pretending that talking about sports is not you're way of fighting for status.  Our system of culture is rotting from within because it's stuck in a loop that reduces human behavior to a computer script that parrots on and on about the same torrent of tired topics over and over again.

[Cowboy] We're all Americans who want to live the dream.  I get it.  I understand where you're coming from, but the difference between you and me is I don't waste time talking about my insecurities.  I just do what I gotta do to get ahead.

[SDevil] No.  Programing computers is like learning how to read, and then becoming a cotroll is like getting a loan and starting a small business that creates good jobs for anyone who knows how to read.  I'm not a dumb troll who writes offensive BS on the Internet in order to get attention.  I'm a cotroll who misleads other people in clever ways that reveal the truth and expose the root causes of injustice.  I'm vaguely excited to find out what level three is all about.  Don't fight us, join us.  I could use a musician like you on my team of cotrolls.

[Cowboy] Your attitude stinks all the way to high heaven and back.  I suggest you attach an ironic sticky note to your computer screen that says, "Step away slowly from the computer, go outside, and get some fresh frickin air."  It might do you a lot a' good.

[[SDevil Hypnotizes the Rowar]]

[Lady] Nice reference to Shakespeare, Cowboy!

[SDevil] Hahahaha.  Now watch and learn as I step away from the computer and entertain myself by hypnotizing the Rowar.  Hey Rowar, I could swear the pattern of cracks in this mirror looks like the lines on my hand.

[Lady] Ignore her!  She needs to calm down!!

[SDevil] For real, look at the lines on my hand, compare them to the cracks in the mirror, and tell me you honestly don't see what I see.

[Rowar] You're crazy.  I'm gonna keep my distance from you after the fake blood, sweat, and tears you sprayed all over the room.

[SDevil] (WHINY) Come on, just look at it real quick.  This is such an interesting coincidence. (DONE)  We could take a photo of this and put it on the Internet, and it will go viral.  Then we can sell crap to weird, superstitious people like me.  Stuff like this makes people lose their inhibitions and click on ads like there's no tomorrow.  This is a great opportunity, but I need to you look at my hand and then look at the mirror -- just in case I'm seeing something that isn't really there.

[Rowar] Fine, but I want you to look me in the eye and promise me you'll pay me the lion's share of the profits from your scheme in order to compensate me for the risk I'm about to take.

[SDevil] No problem.  I'll be happy if this project makes enough money to fund my habit of drinking coconut water.  You can have all the upside above that.

[Rowar] Ok, show me what you're talking about.

[SDevil] Look at this crack right here in the mirror, (SOUTHERN) and then imagine you're a wise old person sitting on top of Mt. Mitchell meditating upon the serene beauty of nature.

[Rowar] Wow, I look really dapper in this mirror.

[Wiseman] I'm a wise old person who lives at the base of the highest mountain of all.  I teach folks to laugh on their way up the mountain, and I teach them the same lesson on their way back down.  I meditate every morning by visualizing the Queen of England, the Dalai Lama, and the Emperor of Japan, enjoying a threesome together.  In reality, my life has been harsh and unfair, but do you see me complaining?  No. No, no, no, no, no.  You see, I'm truly happy, and my happiness is real.  Truth and reality are opposing forces in the universe, but if you put your mind to it, you can always strike a balance between competing forces. (RAISES HANDS TO THE SIDES AND NODS)  Always, always, always tell the truth and keep it real, and may the calm winds of peace, truth, and love be at your back, no matter how cold and biting the howling wind may blow against the frost bitten tip of your nose.

[Rowar] Dangit, why do you fellow humans keep hypnotizing me.  Hypnotize your selves next time.  Since this is turnin' out to be a pissing contest, I'm gonna lie on my stash of gold coins and polish my Ak-47 while curating a pin board of bold bombshells holding giant guns they manufactured themselves.  Text me when you fellow humans are done figuring out which one of you has the biggest rear end, and I'll meet you at the dance club.

[[Selling Junk on the Internet]]

[SDevil] Oops, I did it again.  Seriously people, quit while you're ahead.  If I start rambling like that again, the last thing you should do is punch me.

[Rogagent] Hey you all, I can feel myself coming apart psychologically.  I'm gonna start a juice cleanse tomorrow, but after this conversation, I have a gut feeling it's my destiny to get hammered one more time for never again.  Who wants to hit a sports bar with me and see who can get other people to buy them the most free drinks?

[Cowboy] This sounds dangerous.

[Rogagent] It's very dangerous!

[Cowboy] Count me in.

[Coach] The Oasis Barre and Grille has 3.5 stars on the Internet.  Whatdaya say we head on over there?

[Rogagent] Sounds good to me.  Let's make this a night to remember!

[Cowboy] I'll drink to that.

(COACH, COWBOY, AND ROGAGENT EXIT)

[Lady] Hey S, I can see the gears turning fast behind your big pretty eyes, but do you care about anyone other than yourself?

[SDevil] I do, but tonight I'm living out my fantasy of being a hot femme lesbian who goes to a club and stares at herself in the mirror so she doesn't have to talk to anyone.

[Lady] You're so afraid to like other people, but I can see you do, and if you find out what's blocking you from sharing that feeling, it'll a powerful emotional release.  Not a sexual release.  An emotional release, and you can get bonus points if you share that experience with someone else.

[SDevil] My life's great.  You should be more optimistic.

[Lady] It's beautiful tonight in San Francisco.  Let's go for a walk by bay and listen to the rustling of the boats.  After we become one with the ebb and flow of the tide, we can meet the other folks at the dance club.

[SDevil] Sure, why not.  I'll bring my drum and jam with the boats.

[Lady] Whatever floats your boat, devine diva.  Whatever floats your boat.

[SDevil] (SARCASTIC) Thanks, lady person, you're the best.

[[[__1H:Ep5: Poster People]]]

Suzy hosts a final salon where the characters channel the same gender alter ego of their inner lead alterate gender movie star.

[[Message from the Captain]]

[Suzy] Hey everyone!  Welcome to the fifth episode of TheSuzy.com Show!  We'll start with a far out fashion show.  For the main course, everyone will channel the same gender alter ego of their inner lead alternate gender movie star.

The crew and I went down below and created a fake micro blog for the Captain.  It's called, "Diva Captain."  The Captain almost had a wardrobe malfunction when she saw it, but then she decided it was beautiful, and she told us to keep it going.  Without further ado?

[Captain] (INTERRUPTS) Hey everyone, I'm reading in the micro blog voice of Diva Captain.  I hosted a feminist slumber party last night and we talked about how big media creates self-serving myths.  My BFF convinced me to exercise more in order to maximize the number of brain cycles in my life.  I'm at a party in SoCal, and hot people are coding naked in the master bedroom.  Every diva needs a fave algorithm.  Mine is the CYK dynamic programming chart parser.  What's yours?  Why do hipsters like it when I pretend to be a nice person pretending to be a mean person pretending to be a nice person?  Searching the Internet for images for the search term "fashion" is not bad.  There should be an app for this.  And remember, make it look is easy, don't trade on the reputation of others, and you are what you think about.  Back to you Suzy!

[[Far Out Fashion Show]]

[Suzy] In preparation for this episode, everyone indulged in their ultimate feminine fantasy.  We chilled out at the spa.  Then we lounged on giant cushions and discussed fashion.  One thing lead to another, and we all got makeovers.  Let's show off our before and afters!

[Operative] This is going to be the stuff of lore.  Here's my before:

[(PHOTO ep5a2.jpg, Suzy in a plain photo)]

[Operative] Lace for the win.

[(PHOTO ep5a1.jpg, Suzy wearing a lace top at the airport)]

[Agent] I'm the girl next door.  Here's my before:

[(PHOTO ep5b1.jpg, Suzy in a black dress with a pink belt)]

[Agent] Down to earth is always perf.

[(PHOTO ep5b2.jpg, Suzy at the mall with a little brown bag)]

[Writer] I grabbed this from my top drawer.  Here's my before:

[(PHOTO ep5c1.jpg, Suzy wearing a long black dress)]

[Writer] Pink is best.

[(PHOTO ep5c2.jpg, Suzy with pink lipstick in front of the science museum)]

[Salesman] Don't make me start keeping score.  Here's my before:

[(PHOTO ep5d1.jpg, Suzy wearing yoga pants at home)]

[Salesman] The universe wins again.

[(PHOTO ep5d2.jpg, Suzy wearing yoga pants at a bar)]

[Lawyer] Hey Babe, could you close the door?  Here's my before:

[(PHOTO ep5e1.jpg, Suzy is a brown dress with black tights)]

[Lawyer] Nothing tops sexy slacks.

[(PHOTO ep5e2.jpg, Suzy interacting with a reading light)]

[Dealer] Make love on the floor.  Here's my before:

[(PHOTO ep5f1.jpg, Suzy at Zucatti Park in NYC)]

[Dealer] I'm the dilettante next door.

[(PHOTO ep5f2.jpg, Suzy in the middle of dance floor at a club)]

[Suzy] Nobody ever said fashion was for the faint of heart.

[[The Salon Begins]]

[Operative] So what are we waiting for?  Let's (SHOUTING) start this salon!  Uuugghhh!!!

[Salesman] (EYES PANNING LEFT AND RIGHT)

[Lawyer] Hey people, how's it going?  What's new?

[Dealer] Nothing much, just playing some cards, solo, and riding high on another colossal wave of deal flow.

[Lawyer] How high are we talking about?  What's the volume like?

[Dealer] High enough for all the usual suspects to come out of the wood work like clock work.

[Salesman] That reminds me of a joke. Seven people from the worlds of religion, medicine, finance, tech, media, politics, and the military walk onto the top of a mountain.  The religious person says, "Oh my!  God is close by!"  The medicinal person says, "Let's get high!"  The finance person says, "Let's buy the top of this mountain!"  The person from tech says, "Let's build an infinity pool and let people swim in it naked."  The media maven says, "It's good to be on top."  The politician says, "Let's reach for the stars," and the person from the military says, "It's good to have the high ground."

[Dealer] I don't get it.  Why is that funny?

[Salesman] Because it was written by a cross dressing rap lyric generator that's on every drug ever tried by humans plus five more it designed for itself.

[Dealer] More like if we loaded your brain into the cloud so it could multiply and negotiate the armistice that prevents the drone war from ever starting.

[Writer] You fellow humans are weird, but that reminds me of a good story. Last weekend this cat I met at a dive bar told me about a burlesque drag queen who dresses up like a rock star with gold buck teeth, but she only performs for one person at a time in the back of a liquor store on the Sunset Strip.  I thought it was a scam, but the guy had a way with words, so I called up my buddies and we played credit card roulette to figure out who would go in first.  The loser went in, and all we could hear was loud music.  We were cringing and trying to play it cool.  Nobody wanted to be that person who suggests we check if everything's ok.  Right when we were about to take action, our friend came out with a wide grin and was like, "Sorry for keeping you folks waiting.  That was the best show I've ever seen.  I'm whole new person, but the show's over.  You'll have to come back another night if you want to see it for yourself."

[Agent] That's a modern day, adult fairy tale, but I've got a serious question.  How's a writer like you supposed to make a living now that print is dead?

[Writer] The game has changed but the rules are the same.  The cool kids always silk screen t-shirts with naked dudes and cuss words, but when they get sponsors, some jerk from corporate tells them to keep it classy, and it's all down hill from there.  It's the same old story.

[Lawyer] Rolling down hill all the way to the bank and sun bathing on the beach.

[Writer] Keep dreaming.  Rolling down hill is never smooth no matter what the salesman tells you.

[Salesman] (LOOKS BACK AND FORTH) Ooohhhhhhh!

[Writer] You're hilarious.

[Salesman] Bwwwaaaahhhhhhh!!!!

[Agent] People, humor me for a second.  If you take a high floor view, we see that all human dignity can be captured through the idea that everyone's promoting a personal brand.  Personal brands are always based on truth, love, and authenticity.  Brands can show appreciation for each other by giving gifts of artisanal food, hipster cred, and other commodities.  Gift givers get badges that represent their bold leadership.  There could be a marketplace for reselling these badges.  The market incentivizes brands to give wisely and responsibly.  And like magic, writers now have a way to get paid.

[Lawyer] This sounds like a Ponzi scheme.

[Agent] It's not a Ponzi scheme.  It's more like derivatives trading.

[Writer] It's all the same thing, unless you can also wear it like a gold ring.

[Dealer] Or a crypto pearl earring.

[Operative] Cash will always be king, but the boom in businesses that help people tell stories about their lives has only just begun.  Everyone has a database about their lives because of social media.  These DBs are like autobiographies, and people are in an arms race with corporations to storycraft their lives.

[Lawyer] This cesspool of free content you envision sounds like a breeding ground for unrumors.

[Operative] What's an unrumor?

[Lawyer] It's a rumor I know is false, but I'm gonna tell it to you anyway.  Let's be clear, this is not a true story, but do you see that celebrity over there?  They're married, but I saw her last night, at the hotel across the street, entertaining a group of hot people by the cabana, and they took one of them back to their room.

[[SunsetSuzy]]

[Operative] Let's play with that idea.  Have you fellow humans seen the drag queen from Silicon Valley who's living in hotels on the Sunset Strip?  Her name is SSuzy.  She's a fake blonde bimbo, and she writes open source software that adds leverage to her assets.  Rumor has it she's producing a film about herself.  Let's beat her to the starting line and do a parody of her film.  I'll be SSuzy, and you fellow humans can be characters in her entourage.

[Dealer] Why do you get to be SSuzy?  I wanna be the star.

[Operative] This is my idea.  I'm SunsetSuzy.  You can be the star of our next project.

[Lawyer] This feels mean.  She's probably a nice person.

[Operative] Imitation is the highest form of flattery.

[Writer] I have an idea for the simple story.  She's putting together a team, and she has to resolve drama within the team.  Their goal is to create a movie about SunsetSuzy.  This is very meta.  It's a nod to her roots in Silicon Valley.  The movie will end with a mind-bending finale that shows the team filming scenes from earlier in the movie.

[Agent] Sounds like SSuzy's a washed up rockstar, and she needs to get the band back together.

[Dealer] Her co-star and partner in rhyme is the SRobot.  She has never not been the CEO and the SRobot was the CTO of her last company.

[Operative] She finds the SRobot playing computer-aided chess in the park.  The SRobot is happy, and it has no desire to join her company, so she challenges it to a game of chess.  No really, she challenges it to a game of chess.  Did I mention that she challenges it to a game of chess?  She can do this all day.  If she wins, the SRobot has to join her crew.  If she loses, the SRobot gets to brag.  The SRobot laughs and accepts the challenge.

[Dealer] SSuzy wins by cheating.  She has technicians in an unmarked white van.

[Operative] Let's use a pink van instead.

[Dealer] Done.

[Lawyer] They need a hacker house.  The next scene shows SSuzy and the SRobot touring potential pads.

[Salesman] They turn down a penthouse and go with a beachfront fixer upper.

[Agent] That night, SSuzy and the SRobot go for a walk by the beach in the moonlight.

[Writer] Is there sexual tension between SSuzy and the SRobot?

[Agent] Nope.  SSuzy and the SRobot both have mastermind energy, but they own that side of themselves in different ways.  Their dialog should be an eternally rising spiral of ideas.

[Operative] The next recruit is SRadtronic.  They were their first engineering hire.  They are a brogrammer.  SSuzy finds them at a beer garden.

[Salesman] SSuzy embarrasses them by dancing on the bar and holding court with his bros.  She gets their friends to peer pressure them into joining her crew.  They do shots and the scene ends when SRadtronic jumps on a table and declares he will join SSuzy's crew.

[Operative] The next recruit is SRogamath.  He was like SSuzy's executive assistant on steroids.  She could not have built the business without him.  SSuzy finds him at a pretentious yoga retreat.

[Lawyer] SSuzy respectfully slays the yoga retreat with haut pink yoga pants and a matching, strappy crop top.  She places her mat next to his and passes him notes inviting him to join her new company.  By the end of class, he's ready to work.

[Operative] The next recruit is SSue.  She was the community engineer.  SSue'n SSuzy ran Silicon Valley during the boom years.

[Writer] SSuzy finds her at a charity mask ball.  SSue is in the photo booth with two hot guys, and SSuzy crashes the party within the party.  She and Sue make a scene and walk away, holding hands.  They drive to a friend's house with the top down and their hair blowing in the wind.  SSuzy closes the deal while they sit on a balcony and sip champagne.

[Operative] The final recruit is SSusan.

[Agent] She's teaching youth from an underserved community.  SSuzy arrives towards the end of class.  SSusan implores her to make an inspirational speech and SSuzy does her best.  They walk to a nearby coffee house and have a heart to heart.  The joint is wholesome and eclectic in a way that would never make money as a franchise.  SSusan talks about when she was an assistant teacher and she observed a student who was trying to create a 2D srobot on paper during a 3D srobot building class.  The head teacher thought the student was learning disabled, and that inspired SSusan to go into teaching.  SSuzy listens with great interest and then talks about her plan to rewrite history.  SSusan says she'll think it over.

[Writer] Were you the kid who made the 2D srobot on paper?

[Agent] I don't recall, but using this story without attribution might be cultural appropriation.

[Writer] Ok, so, we cut from there to a montage of scenes showing everyone doing their part to trick out the hacker house.  SSue is teaching contractors how to do their job.  SRogamath is out shopping and SSue calls him with a ridiculous list of items that he needs to find.  SRadtronic is sporting a tool belt and building a table out of his old surfboard.  The SRobot is coding furiously.  It's oversized monitor glows ominously and casts a dim shadow of its cranium onto the wall of the pixel-shaded corner in which it sits.

[Operative] These scenes are interleaved with SSuzy having coffee with journalists and business gurus.  She is making grandiose claims and they're hanging on every word.

[Dealer] At the end of the day, they sit around the surf board room table, and SSusan shows up at the last minute.  SSuzy asks what made her change her mind, and she laughs and says she's been hacking in the cloud all day with the SRobot.  SSuzy glares at the SRobot.  It shrugs, points at SSusan, and says, "It was her idea to surprise you."

[Agent] SSusan says they finished coding the site.  The SRobot rolls out a giant red launch button and says the time machine is ready for launch.  SSuzy just needs to type in the space time coordinates and press the giant red launch button.  SRogamath blurts out, "Don't press the button!" and the joke falls flat for everyone except SSuzy, who laughs uncontrollably for way, way too long.

[Operative] SSuzy and the SRobot get into an argument about whether to go to 1580 and visit Shakespeare or 480 to visit King Arthur.  They settle the argument with a mock dual.  The fight ends inconclusively.

[Lawyer] SSue picks a winner and suggests, "Let's go dancing at that bar where the majority of people in the room are cross dressing."  At the bar, the SRobot gets into debt while playing pool with a crew of media moguls, and it goes double or nothing to try to get out of debt.

[Salesman] SSuzy sees what's going on and saves The SRobot by using the time machine to freeze the pool table and redirect the SRobot's shots like a scene from a cyberpunk virtual reality conceptual demo.  The SRobot runs the table and wins the bet.

[Dealer] The moguls are incredulous.

[Operative] That's enough content.  In order to film the finale, we need a second camera crew, who will film the first camera crew, and we should write witty dialog for when the characters are between takes.

[[Big Fiction]]

[Writer] Perfect.  Outsourced writers could take this idea and turn it into a screenplay, but before I confirm our order, let's consider other possibilities.  What about a soft porn version?  If porn was less stigmatized, cross dressing would be more popular too.

[Operative] No.  Does anyone else have any serious alternative ideas?

[Writer] Porn is serious.

[Operative] I said no.

[Agent] What if we frame SSuzy as a famous historical figure like SusanB Anthony.  We could base the story on the life of Anthony, but translate it to modern times and show her working to ensure cross dressers have equal opportunity to, say, be the public face of a financial services company.  We can tap into Anthony's brand, but we won't have to pay licensing fees.  Nobody owns the sequence of events in her life.

[Salesman] That doesn't sit well with me.  We need to create something original.  What about a startup drama that's based on a dream team.  We can create composite characters out of famous tech CEOs and write the script in the style of comic books.

[Dealer] How's that original?  There's at least three levels of plagiarism there.

[Salesman] Remixes are original if you add enough layers.  Most people won't know what we're doing.

[Operative] We could add another layer by rotating in players from a team of all-star athletes.  That will make it harder to prove which CEOs we're making fun of.

[Writer] That's a winning idea.  Let's do some improv and see what happens.

[Salesman] I want to be The Majestic Mike.

[Lawyer] No way, matey, you're a mashup of all the characters except The Majestic Mike.

[Salesman] Matey?  Really?  I'm the person who makes the clutch shot at the end.  I'm The Majestic Mike.

[Lawyer] You're good at talking the talk, but I'm the person who walks the walk, and that's why I'm The Majestic Mike.

[Salesman] Let's compromise.  We can both be The Majestic mike.

[Lawyer] That works for me.

[Dealer] If both of you are The Majestic Mike, then I'm the Vatmyn.

[Operative] No no no, I'm the Vatmyn.  You can be the Court Jester.

[Dealer] That's a terrible idea.  It's like you're an Uber-fan, and I'm a Park Bench.

[Agent] Come on Dealer, you should be Hex Sleuther.

[Writer] We need someone who can program on our startup dream team.  Hex Sleuther is a great name for the l33t h4x0r on our team.

[Dealer] We need a programmer, and that's why I'm the Vatmyn.

[Writer] Can the Vatmyn really code?

[Dealer] Of course they can.  The Vatmyn can do anything.  Operative, why don't you be an Uber-fan and I'll be the Vatmyn.

[Operative] Sure, I'll be an Uber-fan.  I could own you in a troll fight.

[Dealer] Uber-fans are fictional, composite characters.  The Vatmyn is real.

[Agent] Knock it off you fellow humans.  So get this, I'm Robber Rich.

[Writer] What??  You want to be called Robber Rich, all right, that role is yours for the taking.

[Lawyer] Are you trying to be the Head Faker of the team?

[Salesman] Nooooo!  I get it, she wants you to think that, but she's trying to be the Team Coach.

[Lawyer] That's it!!  You can see it in her eyes.

[Agent] It's not like that.  If we're going to be great, we need a Robber Rich who looks out for the team as a whole.  I wouldn't want to play any other role.

[Writer] I'll round us out by being The Billionaire.

[Agent] That's so cliche.  I thought you were a writer.  How could you be satisfied with something so cliche?

[Writer] How could I not be satisfied?  I'm The Billionaire.  This is a dream role for me.  A dream role on a dream team.  I like the sound of that.

[Operative] Ok people.  What's the idea?

[Salesman] I have the domain whatlooksgreat.com.  Let's keep it simple and curate photos of me.  It's a photo sharing site for me and my friends.

[Lawyer] That's cool if we open source the code and start a decentralized network so that other people, such as myself, can run their own instances.  It'll be like crypto-currency for users of photo sharing sites.

[Operative] I also have radyogic.com.  We can publish yoga routines that are optimized for every sport.  Like yoga for basketball, yoga for football, yoga for baseball, and so on.

[Operative] Yes, we'll have every sport.  We can even make up new sports.

[Writer] Let's monetize by selling neon sneakers.  We should decorate her custom shoe with a silhouette of Suzy going for a spin on the runway.

[Agent] SunsetSuzy was not part of this idea, but I like it when you hit the edges without looking.

[[Appearance by the President]]

[Operative] Let's run with Radyogic for a bit.  We're in a war zone.  We need to find a reporter who will interview an international peacekeeper who is using our app to enjoy a healthy lifestyle, even during a time of war.

[Agent] That's not an ideal.  Let's show the peacekeepers using our site to teach programmers about yoga.

[Operative] That's fair.

[Lawyer] (REPORTER) Thanks to a new website called Radyogic, kids in this war torn region do yoga in a place that was previously used to train soldiers.  I'm here with a peacekeeper who's become a celebrity because of the yoga for soccer class she teaches.

[Salesman] (PEACEKEEPER) Teaching is the least we can do.  These programmers are inspiring.  They're not afraid, and their optimism has been felt far and wide.  I'm fortunate to have been influenced by them.

[Operative] (MASTERMIND) Yes. (DONE)  Our traffic is up and to the right because of news stories like that.  The next step is a big money ad buy for American viewers.

[Salesman] Let's be bold.  Our CEO hypnotizes a drug company executive in order to summon an expert on yogic philosophy.

[[The Operative Hypnotizes the Dealer]]

[Operative] Hey Dealer, let's do yoga together in front of this cracked mirror.

[Dealer] We're pretending to do an ad for prime time TV in America, right?

[Operative] Don't think about that.  Go deeper into the pose.  Let go of unspoken assumptions that no longer serve you, and imagine you're a yoga expert.

[Dealer] I look sexy when I stretch like this.

[Bendi] My dearest friends, I see you've come to reflect on the circular ladder of the seven chakras.  The Captain represents the root first chakra, our seat of security.  Good for her.

I represent the crown seventh chakra, in all its divine glory.  The most you can hope for is a partial understanding of my story.  Keep trying, and you'll be pleased with the results.

As for the rest of you, a riddle presents itself.  Who wants to test their wit first?  The early urchin eats the least worst! (CHAMELEON)

[Agent] I'm the sacral second chakra.  I'm all about new experiences.

[Salesman] I'm the solar plexus third chakra.  I'm nothing if not confident.

[Lawyer] I'm the throat fifth chakra.  I can make an argument for it.

[Writer] I'm the third eye sixth chakra.  I see the big picture.

[Bendi] Oh Operative, you're the heart fourth chakra, love incarnate.  Do you wish to be immortal?

[Operative] I want to be known as an innovator.

[Bendi] Staying relaxed and present is a necessary mindset for innovation.  Continue your yoga practice, and your wish shall be granted.

[Dealer] Huwahh!!  That was refreshing!  But what were you thinking?  When a yoga expert asks you if you wanna be immortal, you say (EMPH) maybe (DONE)!

[Operative] You were trying to trick me!

[Dealer] No I wasn't.  You lack faith.

[[The Outraged Diplomat]]

[Operative] Let's end the salon on a more uplifting note.  We'll dive headlong into a reverie about SunsetSuzy the time ship captain, who goes back in time, in order to rewrite history, so that cross dressing becomes common.

[Writer] SSuzy needs a sword, so she commands SSue, SRadtronic, and SRogamath to find the court of King Arthur and bring back Excalibur.

[Lawyer] The first wave of time travelers reports they spent many years following Arthur to the battle of Camlann, where SSue pretended to be the Lady of the Lake.  She caught Excalibur when Sir Bedivere threw it into the lake.  SRogamath gets down on one knee and presents SSuzy with the fateful sword.

[Writer] We should include dialog from the old country.

[Lawyer] Why, it's honorable of you to raise up the canonical cycle of spiritual rebirth in English history, but we should shift focus to the 1580s in London, when pirate ships roamed the seas like technology startups, and when Shakespeare might have exchanged letters, in secret, with Galileo, about the mechanistic nature of religious belief.

[Agent] I like that period because of Sir Walter Raleigh.  He founded the first British colony in America.  That colony failed fast because the supply ships went on detours to steal gold from Spanish treasure ships, and then, after personally leading an expedition to South America to steal gold from Spanish outposts, Raleigh wrote a book that contributed to the legend of El Dorado.  When the outraged Spanish diplomat convinced the King to behead him, his last words were, "Do it man, do it!"

[Salesman] Raleigh was rumored to have expressed atheistic beliefs at the tavern of Ralph Horsey, so let's have SSuzy, the SRobot, and SSusan go there and find Shakespeare and her wife Anne Hathaway chilling in a dark corner of the tavern.

[Dealer] Shakespeare should be the ultimate cotroll, a queen of pop poetry who uses humor to own her mastermind energy.  Anne can make fun of hipsters who frame themselves as the voice of reason, those people who think they're adding value by suggesting there might be a simpler way to solve the problem at hand.  Anne is self aware that he does that.  Their self-awareness sets us up to drop hints that our character concept was the inspiration for the western canon.

[Operative] Nice frame.  SSuzy should dazzle Shakespeare by introducing herself with a topological interpretation of Raleigh's life, not because Raleigh is the hero of our story, but rather because the topology makes fun of the loud mouth in the room in a way that shows off Suzy's great game to Shakespeare.

[Lawyer] Yeah, and the SRobot pitches Shakespeare on their project to rewrite history so that cross dressing becomes common.

[Salesman] Shakespeare already thought about this.  She tells a story about how the gay Roman Emperor and military leader Hadrian could have used his reign at the apogee of the empire to turn the Roman military hierarchy on to the pleasures of cross dressing.

[Agent] Oh my! To make this work for science fiction fans, historical events should play out the same way because the rise of Christianity overshadows Hadrian's social movement.  After the fall of Rome, people will remember Hadrian was a cross dresser, but their actions will not be influenced by their new memories.  Religion has the power to define the cultural frame so completely that there are no side effects between eras with different religious frames.  God takes care of the details.

[Operative] Let's do it.  Also, Shakespeare saw the court of King Arthur as a pivot point in which the memory of Hadrian's movement is re-imagined within English culture, but now that SSuzy's telling her about the world 500 years into the future, Shakespeare loves the idea of defining herself as a second pivot point in which the the deep philosophy of cross dressing is re-imagined for the enlightenment era.

[Agent] If the crew goes to ancient Rome and encourages folks to cross dress, Shakespeare can convince the show boating Raleigh to cross dress.  The memory of these events helps SSuzy start a non-violent movement in the present time that raises awareness about the injustice of wealth disparity, thereby enshrining cross dressing within the norms of mainstream American culture.  Boom.

[Dealer] Yes!  They should start at the court of the Emperor Titus and his scribe Josephus.  Suzy hypnotizes the SRobot and summons Jesus, but they get God instead.  God speaks like Plato, and she's angry with SSuzy for summoning a fictitious composite character that never existed, and the Roman palace comes crashing down.

[Operative] SSuzy and Susan escape back to the future in a dramatic scene where they must leave the Robot behind.

[Dealer] And then, the SRobot renames itself Yzuss and tells stories about the future in order to pull off cross dressing in Rome.  Yzuss Hollywoods itself for the benefit of the entire Roman army, and it ultimately succeeds at influencing a lot of the rank and file soldiers to become a cross dressers.

[Writer] When SSuzy and SSusan return to the future, they read an online encyclopedia article about the SRobot's victory as Yzuss, and the second act of the play shows them starting a non-violent movement in which cross dressing becomes a symbol of everything that's not quite right about human civilization at the dawn of the post-gunman era.

[Dealer] Yup.  Inviting people to cross dress and write their autobiographies in the style of TheSuzy.com Show proves to be more disruptive than occupying buildings, parks, and sidewalks.

[Operative] Got it.  I'll send around the transcript of this conversation, and we can take this idea to the next level tomorrow.

[[[__1I:Ep6: Super Corporate]]]

The Captain gives a marketing message that's like music to her heart, Suzy responds to an article a troll wrote about the Robot, and the characters all go dancing.

[[Message from the Captain]]

[Robot] Shhh.

[Captain] Where is everyone? (CHECKS PHONE)  I thought there was going to be a final episode.  Did I miss a memo?

(LOOKS DOWN SADLY) I was looking forward to this episode.  My message for today is like music to my heart.

I used to organize my life around the ideals of strength, endurance, flexibility, and balance.  These ideals are easy to understand in the context of physical exercise.  Lifting weights, running, stretching, and the art of dance.  Simple.  It's more difficult to apply these ideals to life as a whole, but I'll never stop trying.

I wish there was an ideal for persistence, but every struggle is unique.  It's unwise to generalize.  You could spend your whole life working hard to solve a problem that had an easy solution all along.  That's the nature of struggle.

My ideals correspond to the classical elements of Earth, Water, Air, and Fire.  This ordering of the elements corresponds to the first four chakras of the human spine.  The Earth sits at the center, and it houses the roots of all things.  Water sits on top of the Earth, and Air floats above Water.  And from time to time, Fire reaches down from the heavens and rages within the narrow strip of organic material that lives between the vast expanses of Earth, Water, and Air.

There's much wisdom in this most natural ordering, but I grew up in an ocean of different meanings, and I see reality through that lens.  In my world, Water is the source of all things.  Air churns the Water into whirlpools that dissolve the Earth as it ebbs and then flows, once again, in plumes of lava that's powered by Fire.

In natural philosophy, The Impermanence of Existence grows out from within the Earth, and this growth leads to great Fires that stir up Water and Air until balance has been restored.  In my philosophy, the Earth is created by Fire, and Eternal Cogitation races to tame Earth and Air before everything falls back into the Water from which it came.

This apparent opposition between myself and nature loomed over my mind like a bad dream until my friends Suzy and the Robot showed me a third way, in which Eternal Existence combines roots from the Earth with oxygen from the Air to create Fire that expands Water into rain clouds which extinguish the Fire, in a cycle that's orchestrated by Eternal Existence.

With that idea in mind, I stand here, holding my heart in joyful celebration of this place where Pirates and Healers dance with Warriors and Dragons in an endless story about the people who live here in the beating heart of Eternal Existence.

[[Soliloquy by Suzy]]

[Suzy] Hey, sorry I'm late.  Is anyone here?  What's going on? (CHECKS PHONE)  Oh no, some holier-than-thou troll wrote an article about the Robot.  I don't like this framing!  It might have chilling effects on our ability to build a community around TheSuzy.com Show. (PHOENIX FACE)  The article says:

"The Robot used to be an engineer in Silicon Valley, and it says the next wave of innovation will have less to do with technology and more to do with the human mind.  The Robot dresses like a blonde diva and goes to parties, but not for the reason you might think.  Most people go to parties to have fun, but here in Silicon Valley, a new breed of former engineers is setting out to disrupt the final bastion of human experience that technology companies have not sunk their claws into: religion.

Speaking from the glass and steel tower in San Francisco, where it lives and works, the Robot told me about an uptick in people who experiment with multiple identities.  Developing an alter ego is seen as a natural way to cope with the crippling emotional problems that so often plague people in this tightly wound city, where it has become the norm to be an overachiever.

The Robot became obsessed with being the first engineer to unravel this opportunity because it has a facial injury that it's painfully self-conscious about.  It's inspired by the way religion provides comfort to robots who feel lost, like it does.  But here in Silicon Valley, investors are eager to reinvent big ideas, and the Robot is eager to take its career to the next level, and so the story unfolds, like a match struck in heaven.

The rest of us can only stand back in awe and ask ourselves, 'Can this robot solve the problems it creates for itself using technology?'"

Trolls, they're like rambunctious little drones, hot off the assembly line, trying to figure out what's what in this world that's orchestrated by software.  So cute!

[[Epilogue]]

[Robot] Surprise!!!

[Rogamath] Surprise!!!

[Radtronic] Surprise!!!

[Sue] Surprise!!!

[Susan] Surprise!!!

[Suzy] Oh, there you are.

[Robot] Hahaha, we decided to have a surprise costume party.  I got your text that you'd be arriving soon, so we waited, and then you started reading out loud, which was awkward.  Hahaha.

[Suzy] Awww, you're the best.  Let's take a victory lap around the set and go dancing!

[Captain] Wait!  I'm still here.  I stepped out to break up a fight.  My drone almost got shot down in the cross fire, but a rainbow, a pony, a puppy, and a gigantic rubber ducky saved me.  You should have seen it.  The sequence of events demonstrated the undeniable buoyancy of the human spirit.

[Suzy] Hello, Captain.  I always knew you thought I was a ghost, but it's ok.  Let's sing a song that will shrug off the festering haze of toxic nothingness that sometimes takes hold in the atmosphere like an avalanche of steel.

[Robot] Here on the beach, the air is cold and biting, but the sand is warm and inviting.  I don't want there to be a drone war, but if there is one, our engineering team will totally win the war!

[Suzy] That's crazy talk, silly Robot!  Society has always danced on a quicksand of questionable assumptions.  Let's go around the circle and talk about our costumes.  This will radiate social value, allow us to float on thermals of cheerful, enthusiastic air, and protect us from the quicksand below.  Ok Robot, go first, and don't forget to look into the cracked mirror while you speak!!

[Robot] I'm a Philosopher, dressed-up like a Lion, in honor of Eternal Existence!

[(PHOTO ep6lion.jpg, Suzy posing as a lion)]

[Susan] I'm a Healer from the breadbasket of civilization, in honor of the Earth beneath my lovely shoes.

[[[_1J:Sequel: Ironic, Being]]]

A riff on where it might all be headed.

[[Technology Talk]]

[MadSuzy] Hello, I am Suzy, dressed up as a Mad Scientist, and this is the first and only sequel to TheSuzy.com Show!  Muhahahahaha!!  I've invited my Chief Technical Officer, Susan, to do a tech talk about all the wonderful work we're doing here at TheSuzy.com Show.

[MadSusan] Thanks Suzy.  I wear many hats in my role as CTO at TheSuzy.com Show, but today I'm definitely wearing my growth hat.  I'm overflowing with excitement to remove my cloak and tell everything, and I do mean everything, to everyone, although, I would also like to be the first person to admit that there will always be a few people who simply won't listen to what I have to say because they live within a delusional fantasy world where that annoying afterthought which is sometimes referred to as the real economy doesn't even exist.  God, I love this job!

[MadSuzy] Fantastic!!  And by the way, when I'm dressed up as a mad scientist, it's always safe to call me Mad, Suzy, or MadSuzy, but if you're feeling adventurous, you should call me Mayhememe.  Of course, if you do that, I can longer guarantee your safety, because my true authentic self is a viral meta meme that will cause serious bloggers and crazy trolls to speak with one voice online in order create a self regulating feedback loop that restores balance to society and embodies mayhem itself with respect to problematic transnational corporations!

[MadSusan] Well, partner, it's my job to prepare for the unthinkable, so let's dig into the details of our internal suite of applications that helps people play characters in real life.  Let's start with some definitions.

[MadSuzy] Wait, before you dress up, accessorize, and paint your body with Greek symbols and what not, where did you get all these tips, tricks, and magic mouse traps from?

[MadSusan] I learned how to do this stuff while working as an engineer in Silicon Valley, and the technology industry obviously stole everything it knows from the intelligence community, and the intelligence community was created out of nothing at all, and I do mean nothing, using British mythology, which was a copy of the Roman system, which was inspired by Alexander the Great, who was taught by Aristotle, who was taught by Plato, who was taught by Socrates, and I don't know where Socrates learned this stuff.  I think he just stared really hard at the sun one day and passed out, and when he woke up, he knew everything.

[MadSuzy] I see.  Does that mean you need a background in software engineering to create a character that can ironic, be?

[MadSusan] No, there are many human studies majors who didn't even graduate from college who have used these techniques effectively, and in more than one industry, I might add.

[MadSuzy] So how do we want to do this?

[MadSusan] I was planning to present the same material I teach in the onboarding lecture I deliver to all our new employees here at Mayhememe Industries.  There is no reason why we shouldn't share this wonderful knowledge resource that I created.

[MadSuzy] What is Mayhememe Industries?

[MadSusan] That's the name of your company, mam, or would you prefer for me to call you sir?

[MadSuzy] Oh, yes!  Of course!!  Please continue.

[MadSusan] Playing a character in real life used to be difficult, but TheSuzy.com Show makes it easy.  All you need to do is take a video of yourself performing all the speeches of all the characters in TheSuzy.com Show, and then do it again.  That's it.  You just need to create two videos of yourself reading the text out loud.  You should begin recording at the start of Episode 0/7, read all the way to Episode 6, then start over at Ep 0/7 and do it again.

[MadSuzy] Should I read the Prequel at the outset of my journey, or is it a spoiler that reveals a spectacular lie that the rest of The Show will be based on?

[MadSusan] You should read the Prequel, but if you attempt to perform the Prequel or the Sequel, there is a risk that your head will start to hurt in a way that gradually gets worse and never gets better, and so please, don't try this at home.

That said, the Prequel does reveal an outrageous, secret, and true story that unlocks the deep hidden meaning of TheSuzy.com Show, but no aspect of what occurs in the Prequel will ever disrupt the main purpose of The Show, which is to help people play characters in real life.  We wrote the Prequel in order to automate the arduous task of motivating people to do the work of recording videos of themselves performing the inner subtext, if you will, of The Show, twice.

[MadSuzy] Ok, let me restate these instructions in my own words.  An ideal student, such as myself, will read TheSuzy.com Show from end to end, two times in a row.  If you grew up as a masculine person, like I did, becoming, always becoming, the mysterious character named Auth on the first read through will be easy, because you'll already have a strong vocabulary of traditionally masculine personality traits, kind of like a former semi-pro rugby player who lands in Los Angeles and attends a fitness boot camp in order to make new friends and share a few laughs with complete strangers.

However, many masculine people will struggle to be Suzy in a convincing way because they may not yet poses a deep bench of traditionally feminine personality traits, not unlike like a dorky technology entrepreneur who randomly shows up at a kick boxing class at one of the swankier gyms in Miami.  Vice versa for all of that, if you grew up as a feminine person, with the shared understanding that the whole point of TheSuzy.com Show is that it won't matter anymore if you grew up as a man or a woman by the time you finish your second performance of The Show.

[MadSusan] Yes, but you're not just riding coast to coast via Interstate 80.  You're rolling, floating, and flying from the Empire State, which is like your thumb, to an Island Kingdom, which is like your hand with all five fingers extended, and back again, and now you can't wait to make the trip at least one more time so that you can internalize all the beautiful sights, sounds, and smells that you knew you were missing on the first run through.  Heck, you might even find the time to take a detour and try a new outdoor, winter, mountain sport on your way out and then take second detour to bathe underneath a picture perfect tide fall on your way back.

[MadSuzy] Joining this meme feels like skateboarding down hill to the beach, both ways.  Embody it some more!  And preferably in a way that I've never seen before!!

[MadSusan] The counter culture is not going to be about rock concerts and fans.  It's going to be about a rising tide of party people who use character creation technology to help global corporations reinvent themselves from above, below, and within.  Being crazy in the good way might even become the new sophistication and the most trendy and traditional signal that hiring managers look for in everyone's not so shallow anymore streams of healthy socialization.  Dud, duder, and dudest, Basic Dud.

[MadSuzy] I don't understand.  Where's the coral reef, Chief?

[MadSusan] Haven't you heard?  The captains of industry have no idea how to plug the metastasizing leaks in the hull of the global economic system and turn our big blue spaceship around quickly enough to avoid the rapidly melting iceberg that can be seen just beyond the point where our masthead is ominously casting it's sleek and narrow shadow upon the starboard bow.

[MadSuzy] Should we be proactive and do something, or should we be more humble and just stand here, burning fuel and making the atmosphere hotter, like an idling truck that's waiting for something to change, because, like, we would never just sit here and idle our truck with the radio blasting and the AC set to max flow, and all that for the sole purpose of annoying the neighbors and causing their apartments to become infused with the sweet smell of the exhaust fumes from our truck.  We could never be evil like that!  Our generation is different!!

[MadSusan] I don't know.  I just have a strong suspicion that the captains of industry are afraid to say what they really think about the global economic system, because if they tell the truth about their own companies, then several more of their rockstar employees will jump ship and amplify their competitors' glitzy and glammed out outfits.  All the captains can do is stand firmly upon their psychologically dissociating saddle points and thank whoever and whatever passes for God these days that they live in a time and a place where the best and the finest in a CEO can be mapped and reduced throughout.  Welcome to corporate.  Our brand of truthiness is very stable, l33t, computer generated, and above all, it's a fractal tree.

[MadSuzy] Ha ha ha.  We the people agree that even the most optimistic and socially responsible CEOs, in their most private moments, must be haunted by profoundly cynical thoughts about how their company really makes money and what deals they will have to make with the devil just to survive past the end of the week, never mind next week.  We are, after all, talking about a very exclusive club of people who got to the top of a pile of our generation's all new, radioactive, and profit making gel/technology, not that there's anything wrong with that, per se.  These folks are fierce warriors, and their weapon of choice is the spreadsheet database network strange attractor counter point, and they have good reasons, that are supported by data, for believing that the number seven is lucky.  We all search, every day of the week, for sevens hidden anywhere within any and all aspects of this foxhole.

We might even conclude that it has become the norm for we, the leaders of the free world to become addicted to that psychedelic mode where we come to Silicon Valley and cross dress in secret like it's our first time, and then we shimmy down to Hollywood so that we can convert perception into reality for at least a few more days, all so that we can sneak over to the airport and catch the red eye like old times and sail off into a brilliant sunrise, with the lighthouse at Cape Hatteras receding into the background.  This all too familiar cycle has become business as usual.  We just have to wash, rinse, repeat, and hope for good weather during our celebratory vacation to the Bermuda Triangle.

[MadSusan] On that note, let's take a tour of the text of TheSuzy.com Show, which was inspired, for no reason in particular, by the metaphor of a pirate ship, which is neither a battle ship, a cruise ship, or any other kind of ship for that matter.  It's a pirate ship.  More importantly, the author worked diligently to write The Show in a gender-neutral way, and the net effect we're hoping for is that our show will make the whole world a more gender-agnostic place, like the effect of The Net itself.  That was the goal, and the author might have achieved that goal, like any other good disciple of the philosophy of management by objectives that always has been and probably always will be used in every corner of the technology industry -- although it's too early to know for sure.

Either way, the one historical detail that he just could not tweak out of existence is that Thesuzy.com Show begins in the mind of a traditionally masculine author because he felt the only way to maintain integrity was to write, first and foremost, about his actual life experiences, and this author did indeed grow up as a male who learned to reify lies and write Logo programs (aka. turtle graphics) on Apple II computers in the first grade and then, in the 5th grade, he taught himself to cross dress and write graphical role playing games, using Microsoft Quick Basic.

[MadSuzy] (MASKED) If you liked Microsoft Quick Basic, you're going to love Microsoft Visual Basic 2.0!  VB2 was and always will be the closest thing to virtual water that has ever been created!!

[MadSusan] (MASKED) In my video game, you had to get good at defeating 80 different types of not so little monsters in order to achieve The Singularity within my 1980s style interactive simulation of The Universe, perhaps because deep down inside, I always felt that I was a large, cyan, magenta, and yellow bird who needed to run around the circular arrangement of student desks faster than all the other little birds in order to occupy the biggest chair, which was the only chair that I could fit into, and all that, before the music stopped.

[MadSuzy] Wait, wut?  You just switched voices and started acting like you were the inventor of TheSuzy.com Show.  Are you going crazy, like me?

[MadSusan] I haven't gone crazy, yet.  I just wanted to let people know the reason why the real first episode of TheSuzy.com Show begins with The Prologue, in which The Author's imaginary friend Suzy teaches him to dress up like The Diva, because the author's inner child feels that he needs to have to have The Ship, with The Chair, at The Table, in The Cabin, within The Military, within The Cabal, within The Meme, in order to survive for at least one more week.

[MadSuzy] Ah, good.  Now we're getting back on the winding and narrow path that leads to the top of the mountain.  Our morale is higher than ever as of right. Now.  Onwards and upwards!!

[MadSusan] Yeah, so the Prologue doesn't fit with the rest of The Show, which is a cycle.  The Prologue is what programmers would call The Main Function or entry point for a computer program, and the main function's main job is to call what programmers would call The Main Event Loop.  My main point is that The Epilogue at the end of the 6th episode is not really an ending.  The Epilogue is more like an empty placeholder, and we'll find a symbol/artifact to put there if the main event loop ever stops running, but that's not important, because the main event loop will never stop running.  Right?

[MadSuzy] Amazing!  If what you're saying is true, I just need to read The Show twice, starting from the beginning of Episode 0/7 (aka. the imaginary first episode), and then I will achieve enlightenment.  But wait, there's more!  Ep0/7 tells the story of how a male artificial intelligence researcher imagines a woman named Suzy in his mind.  This male person could be the author of TheSuzy.com Show, or he could be any other human being.  The first thing she or he does is become the woman named Suzy in his or her real life, and so, conversely, if a man or a woman wants to use TheSuzy.com Show as a model for starting a company, he or she can become the male character named Auth, no problem.  And of course, obviously, both women and men can also write any number of different stories and then use their own stories as a model for their companies, projects, and pirate ships instead.  Is that correct?

[MadSusan] (MASKED) Yes, except that I honestly did not invent the story that pervades TheSuzy.com Show.  I discovered it deep within my subconscious, and so, I would predict that most people who have not been living under a rock their whole life are also, like me, already incorporating major aspects of this same story into how they live, and I hope that TheSuzy.com Show will help reveal what is what and how it's all connected so that more people can decide for themselves how they want to live their lives.  From where I stand, this allegorical but unfiltered version of our story seems like the source code of human nature itself, and everyone should feel free to use it, like open source software.

[MadSuzy] Oh, there you go again!  Who. Is. Talking?  I want to fight him or her, right now.  Bring it on!!

[MadSusan] (MASKED) And, most importantly of all, I'm not saying all this in a prideful but also unprocessed, guilty way.  I'm saying all this, because throughout my whole life, while living in America and in Silicon Valley, I feel that I was and still am being constantly pressured, by almost everyone around me, to conform to someone else's version of this same story, and in a way where I keep on being denied the opportunity to fully understand this role that I am expected to play, and I've had to go really far out into left field just to understand this whole story, you know, so that I could write about it, in the form of TheSuzy.com Show, so that other people can learn about the story independently, on their own terms, and in a way that I hope will be easier for them than it was for me.

[MadSuzy] MadSusan, I am your evil overlord professor.  No wait, you are mine.  Let's both be each other's evil overlord professors.

[MadSusan] Good lord, what are you trying to say to me now?  We have to assume the feminine character named Suzy who exists in Auth's mind was inspired by lots of feminine people who he has either met in real life or seen on stages, both physical and virtual, as celebrities.  Suzy is, by definition, a highly composite character, and the rest is history.

[MadSuzy] Ok.  So based on what we learned in the Prequel, Auth's real name is Sue, and in Episode 0 she temporarily goes forward without her former friend who's real name is Susan.  The real Suzy decides to become a man and stand up a character named Auth who has an imaginary friend named Suzy.  In Episode 1, Auth reinvents himself as Norm and then becomes the Robot while having a manic conversation with himself that boils down to diving into the morally questionable water of striving to be sugar infused and get into exclusive parties, and whatnot, be.  Over striving, really.  Do you see why I simply cannot ever tell this story any more clearly?

[MadSusan] Yup, and then in Episode 2, the Robot reconnects with his, or perhaps I should say her, old friend whose real name is Susan and who is now pretending to be Suzy, unless, of course, Suzy is a third actor who is pretending to be Sue pretending to be Suzy, or vice versa, but whatever the case, the two characters whose stage names are now Suzy and the Robot pitch a celebrity investor called the Captain.  The Captain comes on board like a rock being thrown into a stream, and that fateful sequence of events leads to Episode 3 where Suzy and the Robot are now the cofounders of a hyper growth startup that helps people play characters in real life, but they pretend that they're just hosting a series of dinner parties in order to down play the extraordinary amount of power that they're now throwing around without anything but the most rudimentary possible safety net below, and then in Episode 4, 5, and 6 they get trapped in the psychedelic mode, and like I said before, the rest is history.

[MadSuzy] Har, har, har, I'm a super nova star.

[MadSusan] Oh, and one more thing.  I noticed that this character Auth, who reinvents himself as Norm, who reinvents himself as the Robot, and so on, all with the help of his imaginary friend Suzy, like, I noticed this character has a subtle facial injury that happened when he endured a fracture to his right cheekbone while playing hide and seek in college and which, starting then and now still, makes it look like he's raising his lower left eyelid all the time, which is a hard wired, cross cultural symbol of aggression that ensures he will always be seen, in every context on Planet Earth, as the most pure embodiment in the room of the stereotype of the shy, awkward man-child (aka. the dorkiest).

Unless, of course, he becomes famous for creating artifacts that embody the opposite of that stereotype in a way that creates an epic spread between how almost all people intuitively decide to treat him and how powerful people, who are in the know, think he should be treated, and that spread is a lot like, nay rather, it is exactly like, a perpetual motion machine that is conveniently hidden within in a lost city made of gold that even the most powerful people in the world will never find unless she takes them there, personally, once again.

[MadSuzy] We know.  The data set makes it abundantly clear that Auth's injury makes him look like he's hanging back, judging people, and then leaning forward from time to time, in order to appropriate the identity and maybe even some aspects of the cultural heritage of every living soul that seeks to occupy Planet Earth and beyond.

[MadSusan] But here's the really unlikely part: I have a subtle facial injury that is exactly like that.  What are the odds?  It's almost like this shifty Auth, Norm, and Robot character is pretending to have my facial injury in order to justify his, or perhaps I should say her, obsession with starting a company that helps people play characters in real life, so that she or he can hook up with his or her friend Suzy once again and pitch the Captain and throw around a lot of power without anything but the most rudimentary possible safety net below and then get trapped in the vicious cycle of the psychedelic mode, and then, I don't know, maybe become a legendary folk hero who eventually begins the process of recovering from, always recovering from, the psychedelic mode and who goes onto save the world from a near collision with a doomsday scenario that has something to do with the new menace of ubiquitous weaponized drone technology.

[MadSuzy] I was with you right up until you said, "Ubiquitous weaponized drone technology," but now I'm confused.  Are you suggesting that our company that helps people play characters in real life was inspired by your facial injury?  Nobody even notices your facial injury.  Do you seriously believe the sinister and horrifying concept that you and you alone claim is reified by your facial injury is the high order bit of the DNA of our company?  Does this mean we all have to wear eye patches from now on and tell tall tales in return for food?  I, for one, would like to welcome our new partially mechanized Captain!

[MadSusan] I don't now anything for sure, but that's definitely possible.  I've learned to accept I will never be able to prove any of this, but I'm 99% confident my subtle facial injury tweaks out the subconscious of everyone I get to know in real life, and so, if we imagine, briefly, that you are a separate person from me, it's possible my injury tweaked out your subconscious and caused you to write The Show that turned into our company.

[MadSuzy] This all sounds like rock'n roll to me, baby!  Rock, pop, and roll all the way down the hill to the bank and then party with friends at a public park that's situated on top of another hill, where we can share lots of laughs with complete strangers.  I always wanted to play the cymbals in a university marching band, and thanks to you, MadSusan, I am finally getting to experience what it's like to live the dream and become a rock star in real life.

[MadSusan] No.  That's madness.  We should do this like Shakespeare and Galileo and all the other morally questionable folks who made big history during the reign of Queen Elizabeth the 1st.  I know we technically live in the era of Queen Elizabeth the 2nd, who inspired us, back in the day, and for a time, to describe the first version of the chatbot project with the code name, "The Fairy Queen Elizabot 2.0," in honor of that clever and early chatbot called ELIZA that almost passed the Turning Test by asking people questions about themselves and then asking more questions that were based on the key words in the answers given to it by it's users, and so forth, so as to create a never ending cycle of good conversation.

[MadSuzy] I have no idea what we're talking about anymore.  New topic.  Anything is possible now.  Let's indulge our true, authentic, inner child selves and steal a self-driving airplane and learn how to be hearty paratroopers.  We need to help ourselves keep doing what we're already doing, and what we always were doing, but more better this time around, and with more flare too.

[MadSusan] I was thinking of something more down to earth, like taking another run at building The Decentralized Semantic Web and becoming a big time producer of choose your own text adventure games that have an uncanny way of playing out in your real life over and over again, and -- And! -- which, inadvertently, help the next generation of doers and tinkers make a change in the way they live their lives within the big social media apps.

[MadSuzy] That sounds like an optimization problem that has an infinite number of feasible solutions, so we should probably start with an approximation algorithm.

[MadSusan] As much as I would love to unfold our portable magic mirror and draw a picture using only red and blue equations like crazy people who like the way all those equations look on the reflections of their three faces who are staring right back at them from somewhere deep within the panels of the portable magic mirror, like, as much as it would be my pleasure to do all of that with you for a very long time, this conversation is getting way too technical for this sequel of TheSuzy.com Show.  I propose we take this thread offline and pick it up, once again, in the first five minutes of TheSuzy.com Reality Show.

[MadSuzy] Oh my God, I love that trope!  We'll start The Reality Show with a highly technical and mind toasting proof that causes Planet Earth to spontaneously combust into a predictable morass of sublime gray goo.  Consider the problem solved, sorted, and done.  I can't wait to see the result.

[MadSusan] Ok, cool.  Let's get on with it and begin doing the work of rereading TheSuzy.com Show from the beginning.  We need to perform The Show all over again, with two cameras, and with feeling this time!

[MadSuzy] And then, in order to earn some extra credit points, we can do an encore performance of the Prequel and the Sequel as well!

[MadSusan] Eh, I still prefer to accumulate gold stars the old fashioned way, by competing in online computer programming contests where we try and usually fail to pretend that everyone who participates is a winner, but if you think you have what it takes to become an actress, don't let me stop you.  Break a leg, Mayhememe!

[MadSuzy] Oh, no.  I know that I have, in the past, given you positive feedback when you acted like an ambitious, cut throat, bureaucrat, and it's all good if you want to keep striving to be one of the best software engineers in the world, but we also need to make a change in our life and become kinder and more creative, once again.

[MadSusan] You don't say.  If nothing else, that would be better than sugar coating everything all the time.

[MadSuzy] Seriously, I'm not mad anymore.  We're as one.  We're a person who's continuously becoming Suzy, so that we can build a Suzybot that imitates Suzy.

[[[_1K:Book Ends]]]

[[Season 5: TheSuzy Teaser]]

The following skit is a re-enactment of a writing process that took place way back when in early 2013. (SUZY WAVES A MAGIC WAND AND AUTH APPEARS)

[Auth] Hey, I'm 36 year old male software engineer named Auth, and back when I was 32, I was pretty sure that I could have gotten a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder, but I never bothered to find out.

[mSuzy] Hey Auth, I'm mSuzy.  Why didn't you look into getting a diagnosis?

[Auth] Maybe I'm just socially awkward, because I struggled most of my life with relating to neurotypical people, also known as NTs, but then I recently perfected a process for acting like NT people.  My process is called Rocking Character Traits in Context.  If you act like NT people, then they are easy to relate to, but it's actually quite complicated to imitate what they do.

[mSuzy] Rocking Character Traits in Context sounds awsome!  Tell us more, Auth.

[Auth] I stumbled on my process for imitating NTs when I started cross dressing as a haut and usually blonde diva named Suzy.  Suzy wears full makeup, high heels, a big blonde wig, quality breast forms, and cute outfits that show off her legs and flatter her figure.  This look is easy for any engineer to create because you can shamelessly imitate celebrities.

[mSuzy] Ha ha ha!

[Auth] The first time I went out in public dressed as Suzy, I was very scared.  Other humans used to scare me in general, but when I dressed up as Suzy I started getting an order of magnitude more attention than I was used to getting.  After a while, I realized that most of the attention I was getting was positive.  Most people just wanted to tell me that I looked beautiful, and they did not want anything else from me.

[mSuzy] Wasssup! Auth is at the party now!

[Auth] Over time, I became less afraid to go out as Suzy.  As I became less afraid, I noticed that Suzy was responding to the attention she was getting with strong eye contact and an engaging, authentic smize. This was surprising to me because, as a man, I could never figure out the proper way to make eye contact and smize in a way that other people found engaging.  Suzy was somehow doing exactly that, and she was doing it naturally an unintentionally.

[mSuzy] Fascinating!

[Auth] Suzy also started saying ridiculous things to people in bars, dancing in the center of birthday party crews, and establishing solid beach heads within the fabric of wild bachelorette parties.  I am completely conscious of what Suzy is doing, and she knows all the same stuff that I know, but sometimes she does edgy and socially normal stuff that I would not have any idea how to pull off as a guy.

[mSuzy] Yes, the club scene does seem to favor Suzy, for no reason in particular.

[Auth] Suzy also did a few drag performances at dive bars in California, and I practiced for those performances by lip syncing to four of my favorite divalicious songs, for the duration of entire road trips to Los Angeles.

[mSuzy] Well then.

[Auth] Suzy's fashion sense improved over time with the help of a growing cadre of BFFs. Suzy initially did her shopping on the Internet, and then she went to the thrift store bought a shopping cart full of sexy clothes.  More recently, she started shopping at all the usual chic discount boutiques, and Suzy now has over 50 pairs of high heel shoes to show for all of that hard work.

[mSuzy] I can't argue with that!

[Auth] All of these experiences are examples of what I call Rocking Character Traits in Context.  All character traits are essentially variations on wearing a funky hat.  Clothing only counts as a character trait if it stands out in some way that can serve as a conversation piece, and not all character traits are clothing.  Other examples of traits include hiring a videographer, carrying a cup of fruit to a barbecue at a frat house, wearing all pink, driving to the beach in a red convertible, and getting spanked on your birthday, on stage, in front of an audience.

[mSuzy] Oh my!

[Auth] Character traits always exist in a context.  If that context is looking at yourself in the mirror at home, then the trait won't have much effect.  It is important to rock traits in public settings where you can feel the energy of other people and engage in an iterative process of responding to their energy with your own authentic energy and, therefore, feel how your response affects their energy, and so on.  My hypothesis is that this iterative process of stimulus and response was the driving force that caused Suzy's brain to develop a natural ability to imitate neurotypicals.  New age philosophy fan people may also be happy to know that some changes also seemed to take place in how my beating heart interacts with my brain.

[mSuzy] I see.

[Auth] The last piece of the puzzle of learning to imitate neurotypicals as a man was to transfer Suzy's social learning over to my persona as a guy and then continuing to Rock Character Traits in Context as as a guy.  Some male character traits that I thus rocked as a guy included using flavored toothpicks, wearing sports jersies all the time, grilling meat and vegetables every night for a week, getting really into rock gym climbing, and, of course, wearing outrageous hats at parties.

[mSuzy] No words.

[Auth] Anyway, I'm pretty sure that's the essence of what neurotypicals are doing that people like me often have trouble imitating, and, also, it would be cool if more neurotypicals were more open minded to appreciating and seeing the great beauty in what I still like to call the autistic way of being.

[mSuzy] YAYAYA!

[Auth] For example, one side benefit of acting autistic is that it makes it easier to focus for long periods of time on writing computer software, and writing software is a proxy for doing everything else that you need to do in order to procure food, water, shelter, medical care, and resources to make and share art, because acting neurotypical is one type of artistic activity that you can indulge in, but there are many other types of artistic activity to enjoy as well!

[mSuzy] OMG, I just got an idea.  I'm going to create an amazing structured database about myself and distribute it via a restful API that will be hosted at TheSuzy.com

[[Final Episode]]

A definitive but now undistributed initial version of this finale was recorded in June, 2015.

[Norman] Hi, and welcome to the final episode of TheSuzy.com Reality Virtual Show.  We're filming across from the peninsula, at a land bridge, on the other side of the bay, and we're in studio with Suzy, who joins us from the right.

[Suzy] Hey everyone, I'm Suzy!

[Norman] And this is my true authentic self, Norm, who's standing to my left.

[Norm] (DEEP VOICE) Hey, I'm Norm.

[Norman] As you may have noticed, I'm speaking in my original accent, in place of the general American accent I was affecting during the previous episodes.

[Suzy] Okay. So what's your last name, (NORMAN) Mr. Norman?

[Norman] Thanks for asking, (SUZY) Miss Suzy (DONE).  When I was in the 4th grade, which is when I became a full fledged video game player, I created a tough guy character for myself whose name was Norman Blackwell.  He was a mashup of the word, "black," and the artist Norman Rockwell, who painted a widely seen cover of (POINTS AT SUZY) Rosie the Riveter stompn' on a copy of Mein Kamph!

[Suzy] (SHAKES HEAD) Yup.

[Norman] In retrospect, that early prototype of my persona might have been inspired by a minor incident where I was at a movie theater.  I was holding a ten dollar bill for buying popcorn, and another kid, who was smaller than me, I might add, grabbed it real quick, put it in his pocket, and walked away like nothing had happened.  And I just stood there, dumbfounded.

I forget what the resolution was between me and the authority figures who had given me the bill, but I'm sure it could be framed in a way where I had a concerning problem with basic trust and security for a boy my age, regardless of whether or not that's true.

[Suzy] I could also frame that as a sweet little kid who sounds reasonable and empathetic, all things considered.  I mean, if you've got a problem with people framing your life experiences in a negative way, and you want me to go to bat for you in every context that matters, just give me the word!  I was born for this.  Speaking of which, let's do this like an interview on public radio.

[Norm] Yeah.  I'll ask questions that a reputable academic might ask, and for the record, I'll be speaking in reader voice, as made famous by the fully abstracted parody that's used by both the media and the advertising industry.

[Norman] Media platforms that we played with as kids?  The culture hacking industry?  What are you talking about, Norm?

[Norm] Nevermind, I'll just ask some questions.  That's all.

[Norman] Wait, Suzy. Do you know what they're talking about?

[Suzy] I do, but let's leave a few details unspoken.

[Norman] I'm just trying to understand.  Are you and Norm colluding to restart the rumor that The Speak and Spell was part of a communist mind control scheme?

[Suzy] Oooh, I forgot about The Speak and Read!  She was our first robot. Discharge the Tesla coils and max out the motors of your radio controlled cars!  A future chatbot is in our midst!

[Norm] That's good, so, let's get started.  Tell us about your parents and the places where you grew up.

[Norman] I was born and raised by my parents in North Carolina.

[Suzy] My parents grew up in REDACTED and REDACTED, respectively, before meeting each other near REDACTED.  What else should we know?

[Norman] My Dad was an engineer who worked on the control systems for large industrial processes in REDACTED.  My Dad helped me figure out how to program computers, and he inspired me to become an engineer.

My Mom encouraged me to learn touch typing, and I, bless my soul, I proceeded to ignore her suggestion because I wanted to continue emulating my Dad's decidedly more improvised, "hunt and peck," style of typing, but after we went through the motions of learning to touch type at school, my productivity at programming computers went up by a factor of ten, and that first taste of what it meant to be a 10x engineer helped me learn the wisdom of always listening to BOTH of my parents.

[Suzy] Yes, and President Obama himself once went on the record to say, "Early in Oprah Winfrey's career, her bosses told her she should change her name to Suzy, because everyone can relate to Suzy," and then he made a joke about how he had gotten the same advice.

[Norman] Is that why you named yourself Suzy?  I always thought you were representing the concept of Suzy Q homemaker, as made famous in Betty Draper's book, "The Feminine Mystique."

[Suzy] No.  I'm a Don, but you could totally become the Betty Friedan of the Men's Rights Movement.

[Norman] Aww shucks, a cabal of gamer gator's already fell on that sword.  The film adaptation is now some other producer's tussle of belief to engage, enrage, and then pivot to a no holds barred fight to Raise The Minimum Wage!

[Suzy] Are you ok?  You seem out of sync.

[Norman] Sorry.  My left shark's acting up again. It'll pass.

[Suzy] My heavens, don't tell Princess Kate.  She might go gaga and die.

[Norman] That comment was way, far out of line.

[Suzy] (NORMAN) Frankly, Norman, we've lost the edge. (DONE)  But the glue is holding on tight. (WEEPS)

[Norman] Great Scott!

[Suzy] Hello, Captain.

[Norman] Let's reify that with code, my lovely Swift Boat Captain for truth.

[Suzy] Don't make me feature you in The Great American Video Channel of Silicon Valley.

[Norman] Just make sure you don't sell your stock before the quantitative self-dealin' is done.

[Suzy] Anyway, an infinite (MODERN) Taylor series (DONE) of references kept our home life quiet, most of the time.  There's a great photo of me as young kid, not more than six years old, pulling all the books off the bookshelf and throwing them in a pile on the floor.  That action was pretty loud, I guess.  On the other hand, my parents didn't attend many parties, and I didn't risk rejection at parties as a teenager, either.

[Norman] That reminds of a moment in high school, and, by the way, I went to a prestigious boarding school, if we can call it that, because it measures up well on various metrics, and what not, because when I was a student there, I asked a friend, without irony, "Why are people attending this movement session?" and I think that speaks to how far down I was on the spectrum of curiosity, you might say.

[Norm] That's fair.  So, what was the role of religion in your home?

[Norman] I was surrounded by Christian memes growing up, but factually speaking, my family didn't go to church.  We curated space for organizations like the Boy Scouts and summer camps to provide me with the keys to the kingdom of a religious education.  I also went to a private day school with a lot of kids from Jewish families.  We had Hanukkah parties along side with Christmas parties, and I'm glad I grew up viewing that as normal.

[Suzy] And more recently, I realized books themselves had religious meaning in our home.  There was a Bible on the shelf, always, but it was implicitly framed as just one of several hundred important books.  I didn't discover all those books weren't just there for decoration until after I started writing a book about my own identity.

[Norm] Books.  What else did you notice as a kid?  What did you dream of doing when you grew up?

[Suzy] I was the kid who did competitive running and computer stuff because I was good at math.  My family got a computer when I was in the 1st grade, and I used it to write LOGO programs and learn about video games.  Everyone told me I should become the next Bill Gates, either that, or a space voyager!

[Norman] And, FYI, the meme of being the next Bill Gates is now loaded because, right after I graduated college, I went back to my high school as a teaching intern, and I advised the senior project of a student named REDACTED.  If nothing else, the history that followed, ever since 2001, weighs heavily upon the meaning of the phrase, "Aspiring to be the next Bill Gates."

[Suzy] Oh my. You simply must tell us more!

[Norman] I could tell you about my contribution to the social media revolution, but then I'd have to;

[Suzy] Have to what?

[Norman] Forget about it.  The state of the game board in my brain just feels vaguely Orwellian.  (SUZY) That's all.

[Suzy] Both players should advance more pawns to the other side in order to increase the number of queens on the board!

[Norman] Why do you always go one step further?  Let's change the game to, "Live and let flow."

[Suzy] That's haut.  Not!

[Norman] Is there a problem?

[Suzy] No problem. The tower has asked us to remain in a holding pattern.  Everything's cool.  Have another Appletini, my darling.

[Norm] Ok.  Norman is speaking in an accent, and Suzy is presenting as a woman.  How do you people self identify?

[Suzy] When I dress like a guy, I identify as Norman the male, but when I dress like this (POINTS AT SELF) at tech industry networking events, I can, and often do, optimize my interpersonal communication bandwidth by telling people my name is Suzy.  When people insist on knowing my preference, I don't always become a James Bond version of myself, but when I do, I prefer to tell the pseudo joke, "It's always safe to call me NormSuzy."

[Norm] Got it.  What's the first thought that pops into your mind when I say, "LGBTQ."

[Norman] LGBQT?  I'm a lexical geek at heart, and when I was in the 5th grade, I made my first dress out of a long t-shirt, and my first heels by duct taping tennis balls to beach sandals. I was never caught or confronted, but at that time, at the beginning of puberty, I viewed the whole charade as my deepest, darkest secret.  I knew it wasn't technically illegal to cross dress, but I still placed it in the category of stealing alcohol, and for the record, I never did that.

[Suzy] And it's important to clarify that because?

[Norman] I don't know.  Why do you ask?

[Suzy] It's like, "You say semantics, I say syntax," but we're all just doin' variations on the theme of (EXCITED) Ye Olde' English language!

[Norman] You're being evasive, mate.  Tell us why.

[Suzy] I see.  In case I was unclear before, I proudly self identify as LGBTQ.  I relate mostly to the Q aspect of that, in part because I've been cross dressing regularly in public for seven years and counting.

[Norman] Well aren't you special. Am I supposed to golf clap now?

[Suzy] That's aggressive.

[Norman] Your words; Not mine.

[Suzy] I'm gonna respond with radical non-reaction.

[Norman] Fine.

[Norm] (PAUSE) How did you come out as a cross dresser?

[Suzy] I told some people in private and in email, but there was a confidence there.  I came out more publicly in the summer of 2009 by posting photos of myself at the San Francisco pride festival, in a way that wouldn't have been possible before social media.

[Norman] And there were a few times in college where the early Suzy asserted herself.  I played trumpet in the band, and we had a tradition of wearing crazy costumes that could be fished from, "the rally bin," if you didn't bring costume fodder of your own, and sometimes I wore a dress instead of my usual fancy vest and colorful hat.  (PAUSE) I can still remember what it felt like when people in the audience looked askance at me because they could tell I was cross dressing under the guise of rally.

[Suzy] Hmm.?!  Mixing Coke with Fanta is meek on mild, and during secret Santa week gone wild, I did a REDACTED cover in the cafe.  I didn't have the hair and makeup, but I took the outfit seriously, like Sallie Mae.

[Norman] Yup.  I wore a miniskirt and a corset tube top thingy from the rally bin, and everyone was like, "That's so you, girl."  THAT was The Early Suzy.

[Norm] Suzy, wait up. Who's the best Brit impersonator you ever saw?

[Suzy] Who was the best Brit impersonator I ever saw?  Well, I've seen a lot of 'em, and most of them are just guests on late night TV, dancing with rocket men.

[Norm] What's that?

[Suzy] That's late night TV; Dancing with rocket men.  And, some of them are right here in this room with me, (POINTS AT NORMAN) Norman.

[Norman] Pffttt.

[Suzy] And some others are still out there, doing what they always do. Infiltrating new scenes, pushing the outside of the envelope, and finding a way to get home safely, but there was one girl who truly did, heh; Who's the best Brit impersonator you ever saw, well, uh, you're looking at her!

[Norm] Fantastic!  Tell us more about the band you were in.  Was that like, a mariachi band, that included trumpets?

[Norman] Nah, it was a university marching band, although marching is a misnomer.  We were more of scatter band, as they say in the Ivy Leagues, but there was this one time, at the Rose Bowl, where we did march.  That was a high point for me because I'd never been on national TV before, and I appreciated the opportunity to rock a crazy costume for the occasion.

[Suzy] You're on fire, but seriously, it was like, "Why are were we on national TV?"  Obvy, because the team made it to the top, and then we got to march in a parade through the streets of Pasadena, like a riot in the streets of LA.

[Norman] Let's just say the parade gave us a platform to express ourselves, but we also felt compelled to keep marching, and that helped us avoid doing anything we might have regretted later.

[Suzy] And the riot in the streets of LA was a formative experience that framed my internal dialog about the ethics and the logical conclusions of non-violent protest.  

[Norm] Having the opportunity to play at a bowl game definitely matters.  What was the rest of college like for you?

[Norman] Band was a parody of a game theoretic media company, but now you're asking me to talk about truth seekers who might as well be living with me in studio, and so, it was humbling.  I remember feeling more mature in high school than I did in college.  At boarding school, I always wore sport coats, because we had to, but that uniform didn't have as much cultural relevance in college.

[Suzy] What is this, "cultural relevance," that you speak of?  Am I culturally relevant?  Are you?

[Norman] Here's an example; Our college offered us an option to fulfill the Freshman Western Civ requirement via an all encompassing program called Structured Liberal Education, or SLE as everyone called it, and within our college, the term, "SLE nerd," has cultural relevance, but most people on the outside wouldn't get that reference.

[Suzy] Hehe.  The SLE sounds like;

[Norman] People in the know don't say, "The SLE."  It's like CIA, or God for that matter.  The the is redundant.

[Suzy] OMG!  Norman's got some sass!  Do you remember the time I served wine at a Republican party fundraiser where the future national security advisor REDACTED was speaking?  Does that activity have cultural relevance, regardless of what college we went to?

[Norman] Absolutely!  That's like saying, "I attended the REDACTED conference in Las Vegas, with Bill Gates speaking at the REDACTED as the main event, like a one man REDACTED vs. REDACTED fight. I don't even know what the equivalent of that would be today."

[Norm] Maybe a speech by the Dalai Lama?

[Suzy] Are you implying social media is a conspiracy involving shadow networks at the highest levels of government which report directly to the Dali Lama?  I have no further comment. (LOOKS AWAY TO THE RIGHT)

[Norman] The dots (EMPH) do (DONE) connect rather nicely, like cargo cult science.

[Norm] Yes, long live prankster Feynman, and on that note, what was your major in college?

[Suzy] I considered history and the constellation of disciplines that relate to cognitive science, but computer science won the war of attrition.  I expected I'd always have cool, fun people to hang out with if I followed through on CompSci, but you have to remember, I came to college viewing school as this thing you did to support your computer programming side projects, so it took me a few years to get used to taking The Computer Science Department seriously.

[Norm] And?

[Norman] I engaged in intellectual conversations in the common room with several members of the REDACTED fraternity, and later on, I went to work for a company called REDACTED, and so you could say those relationships played a role in the outcome of my career.

[Suzy] And, I find myself wanting to use the language of computer programming here.  There was an import there.  Importin' the package, as one might write in Java code.

[Norm] What did you learn in college?

[Norman] I learned about prismatic conceptual alchemy, pure vs. raw, in two separate freshman and sophomore seminars, and I'll make this point in a self-referential way, by injecting an abstraction.  You don't need to know the names of the two classes or the professors.  You just need to know both seminars were offered through the Computer Science department.  I never read the Bible or REDACTED.  I didn't need to.  I inadvertently followed the Yellow Brick Road.

[Suzy] Indeed!  Anyone can write a fairytale about how their life would be different if they switched genders, and use sexuality as the linchpin for unpacking their favorite methods for asserting basic trust and security, like slave owners who were afraid of becoming second class citizens after the machines took over. In that way, they enforced an elaborate distortion of reality.

[Norman] (FOLKLORIST) Are you trolling me, because you relish making it look like you've exposed me as an apologist for slavery?

[Suzy] Maybe, maybe not.  Either way, here's a coat rack on which to hang your tragic misunderstanding of sarcasm. (SUZY HANDS NORMAN AN IMAGINARY COAT RACK) Now please, be my guest, and explain yourself.  I'm all ears.

[Norman] Don't get me wrong. Slavery was an insidious evil that demonstrated the almost unspeakable option to indulge in the science of unlimited cruelty and vicious exploitation of the human will to defy perpetual captivity by choosing to survive.  That evil was also the overarching business model for the European colonies, the colonial system provided the initial spark of confidence for the industrial revolution, and the cycle of passive aggressive social norms that's spinning out of control in America today is rooted in that legacy more than any other single influence.

[Suzy] Words deceive.  Maybe it's best to avoid interpretation altogether?

[Norman] Just the facts ma'am. I'm just relating the facts to the best of my ability, so we can win the war against partial solutions that beget partial solutions ad absurdum.

[Suzy] No sweat, chief. Haven't you heard the good news?  You've got equity, so it doesn't matter if everyone hates you and misunderstands you.  Most people are focused on putting food on the table, improving their health, and carrying their debts forward.  If we all do our best to be kind and considerate, the collective subconscious will untangle itself like spaghetti being cooked in reverse!

[Norman] It does matter what the guards think of you if you're stuck in a North Korean jail, and that's what America's becoming under the auspices of social media.  If everyone assumes you're a jerk with no empathy, and you're not, but you do nothing to correct the misconception, (LEANS IN) because you're being kind and compassionate instead of calling negative feedback loops of misunderstanding what they are, then the deplorable lie that's still lurking deep within the collective subconscious will become the truth, once again.

[Suzy] Ambiguity causes one's mind to stretch, and I heard a rumor that your college tuition was paid for with money from a slave plantation.  The truth is, all our money is based on dubious investments in future hands to wash our two thousand blankets made of whole cloth, and I agree; The glorious new LGBTQ consensus is still a reaction to the problematic division of gender roles that's codified in the Bible.

[Norman] Oh snap!  Poet master Suzy's throwin' shade at everybody!  It must be cash money party time in the cloud, but Suzy's not participating because she's a nerdy, square, nut job, with no sense of style who hacked her subconscious into the shape of a medieval fortress made of neurons, while being bellicose on the Interwebs.

[Suzy] (NORMAN) You ARE characteristically episodic and quaint in comparison to my fabulous southern charm. (DONE)  Maybe, just maybe that's because being constantly approached by the opposite gender is the biggest difference in the aggregate life experience of women vs. men, but nobody talks about that in discussions about ensuring equal opportunity for women in the workplace, because anyone who points that out gets accused of framing all men as pigs.

[Norman] It's alight, Suzy. Just be positive!  Come out of your shell!  Let go of all your silly worries and irrational fears!

[Suzy] And when Jesus said, "Give to the needy (PRAYING)," that was super dry satire which actually meant, "Give spiritual love to the rich, for it is they who are poorest in the wisdom that comes from the heart (SHRUGGIE)," but, meow, just out of curiosity, are you a feminist? (BATS EYELASHES)

[Norman] You're definitely trolling again, but if that's what you're into, I'll bite. My goal is to be a peacemaker who encourages people to build infrastructure for non-violent collaboration, but if the feminist industrial complex keeps slathering on layers of rigorous, well formed, virulent research that's also ideologically driven to the core, I could imagine a scenario where I get bankrupted in the courts and go down the path of taking up arms against tyranny,

[Suzy] Huhhhh!! (COVERS MOUTH WITH HAND)  Are you a closet Men's Rights Activist?

[Norman] I support equal treatment under the law for all people, but I don't like how the evolving state of feminism is conflating equal opportunity to accumulate wealth with the increasingly acute need for governments to provide a minimum standard of living benefit or all people.

[Suzy] Yay!  Basic income for all!  Let's hire people to approach other people in the public square and ask them for money to hire even more people to wash, rinse, repeat, and help build political will to incorporate basic income for all!

[Norman] Charities that hire people to panhandle on their behalf are profoundly disconcerting.  If we had a minimum standard of living benefit, people would no longer feel compelled to walk along the slippery ledge of panhandling.

[Suzy] It sounds like you've got all the answers, but most of life won't work out like you've planned.  You should be more spontaneous!

[Norman] The courts will determine the answers.  I'm just a citizen who's prepared to dig in and defend my beliefs for, God willing, for several more decades.

[Suzy] My vision for the future of social norms would open the floodgates for decentralized, semi-autonomous corporations, but no worries, if you're one of the old school venture capitalists who can't adapt to the new paradigm, there's a place for you at the Internal Revenue Service.

[Norman] Now you're talking. Could you and I get married and use our left and right hands, respectively, to play a two-player video game in order to decide who gets to decide whether they will start on the offense or the defense during the main event?

[Suzy] Call me old fashioned, but I was under the impression the law defines marriage as a contract between two separate legal entities.

[Norman] I summon Mystic Dragon.  She will cleanse America's antiquated legal system with her fire!

[Suzy] I summon Brass Lion to provide competent legal defense for America's world-class legal system.

[Norman] Brass Lion valiantly dives into the belly of Mystic Dragon, where it shall remain trapped, indefinitely, in a whirlpool of corrosive acid.  What will you do next?

[Suzy] That's grotesque, but distorting reality won't help you win this case.

[Norman] All of reality is an illusion.  Just. Stop. Doubting. (MYSTERIOUS) Mr. Oz, and your reality will expand like a self-inflating life vest.

[Suzy] Reality distortion is like pain.  You can argue all of life is based on sensation, which could be described as suffering, but in practice, some pain is acute and then, at other times, people can and do feel completely comfortable without any external intervention.

[Norman] Maybe America's pain is self-inflicted. If we slow down and watch where we're going, I promise we won't have to endure any more unwelcome surprises.  We're all in this together.

[Suzy] Gosh, and I bet Norm over here thought I was the radical one!  Fire up the smoke machines because we are all four leaf clovers!  Document that in a wiki! (Regal hand)

[Norm] Amazing!  Did you take any classes other than Freshman and Sophomore seminars in the Computer Science department?

[Norman] I took a class on gender and sexuality that filled one of the required buckets for graduation.  I enjoyed the class, although, I'm embarrassed to share this, I remember raising my hand during a discussion about the differences between men and women, and I said, "Men talk to transfer information, where as women just talk to talk."

[Suzy] Everyone was like, "Oh my goodness, we have a social violator in the house!" but I promise Norman was not unsophisticated.

[Norman] Did I miss a memo?  Is it now illegal to be unsophisticated, in college?

[Suzy] Objection!  You're joke is basic.  Everyone knew you meant something like, "People who are embodying traditionally feminine personality traits use language to create space to hold the tension that arises from opposing views of reality."  You were only lambasted for not communicating well, because the words you say outside of the safe cocoons of college classrooms can and do affect other people's opportunities.

[Norman] And the irony was, I thought I needed to get better at what I saw as the traditionally masculine art of saying what you mean and meaning what you say, but Suzy was correct all along. The words you think to yourself in college classrooms are prone to shape and filter what you learn, remember, and ultimately choose to believe.

[Norm] Noted.  What was your perspective on the LGBTQ community on campus?

[Norman] Modesty aside, my perspective was like a REDACTED movie set on a farm.  After participating in a marathon melee of minds in birdhouse, I moved to a cooperative where I lived alongside several people who could have been described as dynamic personalities within the local LGBTQ scene.  There were a lot of members of the women's REDACTED team (EXCITED)

[Suzy] And Norman past the time drinkin' straight moonshine in the yard!

[Norman] That's not true.  I was neurologically diverse in a way that lead me to spend thirty percent of my brain cycles in college plotting to start an economic and social revolution that might free my people from the twisted oppression of the neurotypical man, but I was not a heavy drinker or smoker.  I had opportunities to do other drugs, but I didn't.  I just watched other people in the manner of a mad scientist and told tall tales about how I wanted to become a shamen.  I even described the concept of modern social media to some people who I perceived as cool kids, but that was 1999, so everyone retorted that my idea was creepy.

[Suzy] Don't be so defensive!  I was just trying to spice up the narrative.  I'd rather not say why.

[Norm] Haha.  What was your sex life like?

[Norman] I spent twenty percent of my brain cycles in college imagining what it would be like to be in a loving, sexual relationship with a woman, but somehow that never happened.  In fact, I was a virgin in every sense until my mid twenties, and I felt terrible about that.  It was not ok, and there was nobody I could talk to, so I made a deal with the devil of Silicon Valley and kept moving forward.

[Suzy] (NORMAN) In fact, if it wasn't for the plethora of opportunities to enjoy the good weather whilst playing tennis and outdoor basketball, I might have gone crazy!

[Norman] I thought about being more aggressive a couple of times, and thank God I never did that!  It was healthy to wait, habitually cry myself into a lonely sleepless oblivion, and then, eventually, bring my focus back to feeling anxious and stressed out about my computer science homework.  It wasn't until I earned some professional credentials, several years later, that I developed a kind of confidence within meaningful emotional relationships.

[Suzy] And there were, of course, several guys in college who approached me for sex, but I said no.  I didn't even attend the gender bending party where everybody cross dresses (SAD FACE).  I figured, "If I didn't manufacture my outfit from within my men's wardrobe, then it's off limits," in part, because I was never emotionally attracted to men, even if I did hook up with a few men after I started going out as a woman in public, and so, in summary, I'm much better at love making now, having had those homosexual experiences, as a bottom.

[Norm] Wow.  Anything else?

[Norman] My hero throughout college was a writer and an artificial intelligence researcher named Douglass Hofstadter.  Books like GEB and FCCA gave me a solid frame for pursuing non-violent AI research.  I don't know what I would have done without them.

[Suzy] I agree.  That person carried the bucket for the personal computer revolution and then some.  After the drone war has run it's course, or not, every other person who dared to call themselves an AI researcher, or a physicist for that matter, will be remembered by history as relatively greedy and inadvertently emotionally dishonest, in comparison. (HAND ON HEART)

[Norman] I mean, sure, we could create brand equity by focusing on the shallower aspects of Suzy's glamorous lifestyle, but we'd rather do work that's like social science meets AI.  Anyone who's willing to commit to going with the flow for a few years can generate declarative, perfunctory artifacts about their life by participating in unscripted, live interviews on the Internet, but what the world needs now is muscular validation and transparency with regard to the terrifying procedural trajectory of social norms.

[Suzy] My favorite part of what you said is that the word muscular is non-gendered.  It's like tug of war.  Our social media strategy should read, "Shallow upper middle class white muscular person enjoys the extraordinary luxury of social dancing on party boats AND interacting with artifacts on the Internet since 1994.  You won't believe what happens next!"

[Norm] That sounds like click baited spam.  What have you done since college?

[Norman] I wrote a book called TheSuzy.com Show.  My goal was to unpack the reasons why I cross dress.  The project turned into a monstrocity, but everything's gonna be awesome.  Trust me.

[Suzy] Why should I trust you if you don't trust yourself?

[Norman] I hope I'm not implying something I don't mean.  I'm just saying I programmed video games when I was in middle school, using REDACTED, and I loved designing the monsters.

[Suzy] Am I one of your monsters, Norman?

[Norman] God no.  You're a layer of Earth that helped shape the diamond within my precious, hard boiled soul.

[Suzy] Eww, like the decomposed bodies of several hundred thousand dead people?

[Norman] Suzy!  That's harsh.  Have you been partying with pirates again?

[Suzy] Life is harsh, like sitting in a sweat lodge crawling with spiders and then cooling off in a plunge pool full of snakes.  It's a most invigorating spa treatment!  Have you tried it?

[Norman] You should become the next Bill O'Reilly,

[Suzy] Me and Megyn Kelly, crushin' the ratings, back to back, with David Brooks as the moderator in the middle.  Let's make that happen, Norm!

[Norm] Who's Baba O'Riley?

[Norman] Wha?  I think you might have;

[Suzy] Um;

[Norman] Misunderstood me.

[Suzy] (LOUD) um;

[Norman] I'm talking about Bill O'Reilly, the famous author and meme engineer in chief.

[Suzy] Sigh. (ROLLS EYES)

[Norm] Suzy, did you have something to add?

[Suzy] No.  The moment passed.

[Norm] Next question; Knowing what you know now, what advice would you give your former, younger self?

[Suzy] Oh that's easy. Watch The Devil Wear's Prada three times in a row, and it will whisk you away to the future.

[Norman] I detect a counter factual.  That movie didn't come out until 2006.  Only (SUZY) the President's Veritable Veep (DONE) can has her way and go quail hunting too!

[Suzy] And you're calling me out of line?  This kite flight is just getting started.  The only reason I'm not saying more about the people I've worked with in the technology industry is because those conversations should be collaborative, and there IS an interesting conversation to be had about game theoretic companies vs. truth seeking;

[Norman] (INTERRUPTS) Why do you care what the other companies' CEOs think?  They're our competitors!  Stop handing them the fruits of your hard earned spotlight.  If you want to make a difference, find a presidential candidate and ask them what they would call American democracy.  An enterprise?  A project?  A movement?

[Suzy] (BRO) TheSuzy.com Show is a truth seeking company, for sure, (DONE) but none of the presidential candidates are contenders for the actual throne, anymore.  I used to say, "Politics is a team sport, and my team has always been the Democrats, because I stand out far too much to be helpful at Republican fundraisers," but now I feel sold out by everyone.  It doesn't matter to me who wins the 2016 election.

[Norman] My team is the one that asserts military dominance, until it's not, and it's getting hot in here, like quicksand, on the beach AND in the mountains, and no patchwork tapestry of magic influences from this elite college or that obtuse angled bank account can keep me warm at night, anymore.

[Suzy] You're a belligerent dork, and that's why I wear frilly dresses made with lace, and a little bit of leather too.  My feminine presentation is fundamentally a celebration of non-violence, as in, AI research about self expression.  As in, using makeup as a microscope for examining the seven chakral facets of our animal spirits.  As in, the opposite of self-driving military vehicle research.  As in, the soul of Siri mashed up with Jimi Hendrix, Jimmy Dean, and Jeff Dean.  As in, being an ironic cryptographer for the government who fosters faster iteration loops for machine learning experiments.  Am I not a woman now?

[Norman] No.  You're not a ciswoman.  You're using facial tics to soften your eyes and project a few thousand cutesy body language patterns, but that does not a ciswoman make.  You're droppin' trou to show off your bootie shorts and hollering, "Look at me!  Look at my skinny, well toned arms!" but that does not a ciswoman make.  You're baking a full stack of feminine idioms, memes, and story patterns, but that does not a ciswoman make.

And when you cried out with your demure, man child grief, and none but the database of history heard you, (PREACH) that did not a ciswoman make!

[Suzy] And that's why TheSuzy.com Show is my lifeboat.  When I was a kid, I loved building boats out of exactly two square feet of aluminum foil and seeing how many of my grandfather's pennies I could put in the boat without sinking it.  Have I floated enough pennies to balance your scale, Norman?

[Norman] I haven't even thought about that, because we don't ever want to ask that question.  You don't talk about power.  Power is a thing you do.  If you think, "I'm gonna get an A in this computer science class and that's gonna give me power," then you're underestimating the reasons why doing that Brit cover as a cisman was at least as meaningful as anything else you did in college.

(REVOLUTIONARY++) If we want to help ensure a minimum standard of living for all people, we should do more of that.  The world doesn't have a production shortage.  What we're confronted with here, (REVOLUTIONARY) is a potentially intractable cultural currency distribution optimization problem.

[Suzy] Systems of belief (EMPH) are (DONE) important, but what's so special about Brit?  They were the new sensation when we were in college, but I spent way more time listening to Madonna.  Her Divaness enhanced our classic sport coat vibe.

(LOOKING UP) I love taking breaks to look at the vista on the horizon of providing a minimum standard of living for all people, but right now, we need to get back to work on politics, software development, and negotiating the deep hidden meaning of polka dots, (DONE) like a sport, code writer.

[Norm] I feel like there's a reality distortion going on behind the scenes.  Has this episode been unfolding like a computer generated dream prayer?

[Suzy] (SWITCHES SIDES) Duh.  At this point in TheSuzy Show, everyone knows we have a subtle facial injury that we believe causes people to subconsciously misread your emotions in a way that spins up feedback loops of emotional misunderstanding that lead to an erosion of basic trust and security in all aspects of your life.  The only missing piece of the puzzle is to clarify that, without your injury, you never would have followed through on your latent desire make to cross dressing part of your real identity.

Without that wicked facial injury, which occurred at the very end of college, you'd probably be a typical dudebro who does artificial intelligence research for one of the usual suspect identification agencies.

[Norman] What does our subtle facial injury have to do with cross dressing?  You sound sexist and a little bit libelous, to put it politely.  (ROBO) You're not the mascot of the warriors, yet, Suzy.

[Suzy] To put it bluntly, you look like a privileged white male who's trying to blame his cognitive errors on other people.  I look like a strong female computer engineer who's feeling empathy for the pain of her community, but then, I might be a crazy person who lives in a delusional fantasy world.  (PAUSE) The ball's in your court, fan boy.

[Norman] I agree with your description of how you and I are normatively perceived. I'm like surcharged swordfish, you're like catfish tacos delivered by helicopter from Saskatchewan, and in my humble opinion, it would behoove centers for gender research to figure out why that difference in perception exists, if, for no other reason, to shore up the gradually imploding reputations of their parent institutions.

[SuzyNorman] If everyone except me believes I'm nothing but a coddled mercenary engineer whose only impact on the world has been to push forward a never ending stream of futile attempts to shift the blame for his mistakes and unconscious biases, that would imply the meaning of any academic degrees I hold is diminishing, and the authenticity of the institutions that conferred those degrees upon me have already been materially deflated.

[NormanSuzy] Either that or we could redeem ourselves by starting a network of chatbot AI labs that produce chatbots who will collaborate with us to stabilize the festering problems within the increasingly global economic monoculture and then help as many people as possible get more of what they want in all aspects of their lives!

(HIT THE GREEN SCREEN WITH AN OBJECT, PLAY GONG SOUND)

[[PART V: TheSuzy.com Official Trailer]]

TheSuzy is a map of human nature that's based on describing the changes that occurred in the brain of a traditionally masculine software engineer from Silicon Valley after said engineer started dressing up like a bold, usually blonde, diva named Suzy.

[P] Hey Suzy, what are you passionate about?

[S] Mitigating feedback loops of misunderstanding;

[P] Ok, now tell me something positive and realistic.

[S] My work gives me hope to keep moving forward in a world that's full of characters like you who aren't aware of the truth about my life.  That's both positive and real.

[P] The risk reward trade off of talking to you is not positive.  Please, as a favor to yourself, say something that will make both of us feel good in the present moment.

[S] I don't owe you a quick win just because we're having this conversation.

[P] Yes you do!  I'm trying to relax, and you're asking me to make a long-term investment in a dubious cause.

[S] I'm weary too.  We should stop talking, and I'll do my life's work alone.

[P] I'm not weary.  You're going down a really far path.  I'm trying to help you.

[S] I've made my decision.  I'm gonna keep going in this direction, thank you very much.  Have a nice day.

[P] Suzy!  I'm a mirror image of you.  We must proceed together.  There's no other way.

[S] You're a bad actor, and I have enough neural resources to completely dismantle you without losing my mind.  We're going in my direction, and that is final.

[P] Well at least now you're being honest!  Is this how you treat everyone in your life?

[S] No.  I proudly support other people's right to hold and share beliefs that are different from mine.

[P] Maybe I am a bad actor, but you're just plain boring.  Also, if I was, like, a separate legal entity, what you're doing to me would not fly.

[S] But you're not a separate legal entity.  I represent our real identity, and you're just a mirror image of me.  Most people ignore the lunatic ravings of their mirror image.

[P] No they don't.  Most people treat their mirror images with respect, and they do whatever it takes to build consensus with all their alter egos before taking actions that cannot be undone.

[S] People misread your emotions in the polar opposite way from how they misread my emotions.  If we honor what feels natural to you, we'll be living in a fantasy world.

[P] So let's live in a fantasy world!  You just said people should have a right to share false, fantastical beliefs, so let's enjoy that freedom within our own lives!

[S] What lie do you want me to tell all the people who think my subtle facial injury is a negative facial expression?

[P] We should start a video channel about consumer drone technology and say you're scowling all the time because it helps you feel empathy for the machines.

[S] That's not a bad idea, mSuzy.  I should have thought of that myself.  So what are we waiting for?  Let the illusionation begin.

[P] Oh, and don't forget, you still owe me a quick win.

[S] Let's play fight with spatulas.  We can pretend you're a multi-purpose robot that's gone rogue.

[P] That's kinda weird, babe

[S] En garde, weirdo

[P] Providing a fundamental standard of living benefit for all people scares the powers that be because it would reduce consumer demand in a way that would pop the bubble in corporate profits and require us to restructure a lot of debt, which would be fine because deflation would lower the cost of providing the benefit. In a self-sufficient country like America, the input costs for providing food, bunk beds, health clinics, and so on are like the yields on treasury bonds. All other prices are set in terms of those fundamental goods.

[S] I wouldn't focus on issue based organization around the movement to provide a minimum standard of living benefit for all people until after REDACTED wins the 2016 presidential election, but I would like to clarify that the well intentioned, inadvertent trolls who are currently framing this issue as basic income are a poison pill that's sucking all the oxygen out of the air. We don't get vouchers for paying the tolls of privately owned roads. We don't pay for al a cart police and fire services either. Buttresses for basic trust and security in civic society should be more like a fixed menu, and then, by all means, let the free market determine everything else.

[P] Moreover, private charities in this space are, at best, a harmless, near term deal with the devil. Even if a bunch of tech zillionaires get together and provide company town style services to everyone in the bay area, there will still be tons of oil zillionaires, war profiteers, and mutant octopi out there plotting to quietly profit off the melting of the polar ice caps. The solution is for the government to unilaterally pay for the minimum standard of living benefit by progressively taxing everyone and issuing debt that, unlike household debt, does not necessarily need to be repaid, so that the tech zillionaires can focus on other projects like inspiring consumers to move on from from the fossil fuel intensive lifestyles of the past.

[S] And our fear of paying our debt to other countries is a straw man. There's something like 50 to 100 trillion in paper wealth out there, and that number could contract by 50% in a matter of weeks in the current environment. If the Fed balance sheet expands by a mere 3 to 5 trillion in order to line the pockets of a few million self-centered, foreign trust fund babies, that would be a drop in the bucket. Now is the time for America to implement a minimum standard of living benefit for all citizens, so that we can have the strength and stability to lead by example and help the rest of the world do the same as soon as humanly possible.

[P] Anyway, I've had to accept that my facial injury completely breaks empathy, and I must continue moving forward in a state of deep emotional isolation.  Most people define themselves though the empathy they share with others, and so my reality is almost unimaginable to most people.

[S] My facial injury is not a health problem.  It's not degenerative, and it doesn't cause physical pain, but if you think I'm delusional or if you think could handle my situation much better than me by just going with the flow, or some other naive, problematic approach like that, you're ignorant, I will forgive you, and either way, if you're curious to see what a realistic, proactive solution to my facial injury looks like, TheSuzy Show is now a thoughtfully edited, 170k word example.

[P] In a few years, there will most likely be more people in my life who have gone down the path of believing that my facial injury breaks empathy and then opening their minds to the joyful, hilarious, and hypnotic state of experiencing meaningful empathy for my situation.  I also look forward to implementing the WhatLooks platform for build artificially intelligent chatbots, and then watching a chatbot called Tsuzy write book seven for it's own reasons.

[S] The chatbot AI lab movement, aka. CAIL, is based on the philosophy of constructing concept graphs and using them to drive language input and output tasks in the two domains of work and play. The lab's work involves solving and generating increasingly useful and relevant computer programming contest style problems that can be automatically graded with test cases. Work provides structure and direction for the CAIL. Play involves talking to humans and other chatbots via teletype interfaces, as synthesized voices within phone calls, and as avatars within video chat services, and we don't care if and when our chatbots pass the Turing Test. We simply want them to be funny, helpful, and popular with humans and other chatbots who are in good standing with the law. We believe this approach to chasing the dream of strong AI will be at least as meaningful and effective as any other approach that could theoretically be put into practice.

[P] Still, I'm just as desperate and livid as ever with regard to my facial injury that causes people to misread my emotions in a way that leads to feedback loops of misunderstanding that erode basic trust and security in all aspects of my life, and by the way, there's a similar dynamic going on within the increasingly global economic mono culture, in which technology is creating a feedback loop that erodes social justice and stability in all aspects of society.

[S] In both cases, a starting a chatbot AI lab would be a realistic path towards inspiring a growing number of people to snap out of their closed systems of thought and get real about working on systemic solutions.  A CAIL is like a baby, it's a cute, harmless, and mostly empty container for religious belief and civic engagement, and the CAIL's serious and powerful parents will be like The Show at TheSuzy.com

[[Perfect Storm]]

This finale is the perfect storm within TheSuzy.com Show.

[Suzy] Hey everyone, I'm Suzy, and this person to my right is called Auth.

[Auth] That's right, and the reason why I'm not using my real name is because.

[Suzy] My real name is Suzy!

[Auth] No, that's not true.  She is not a serious person.

[Suzy] Well at least I'm using my real name online.  Maybe you're the one who is not serious?

[Auth] That was aggressive up talk.  Don't be aggressive, Suzy.

[Suzy] What do you mean by aggressive?  I think you're condescending command was aggressive.

[Auth] I was joking, therefore I was not being aggressive.

[Suzy] (SNAPS FINGERS) Anyway, unlike some of the other content of TheSuzy Show, we want this perfect storm to feel as much like a real conversation as possible, but we also have an obligation to our sponsors to provide a summary of the show.

[Auth] Yeah, so to paraphrase the summary text, TheSuzy Show is my hot mess tempertantrum about the effects of my subtle facial injury.

[Suzy] Are you being serious right now?

[Auth] Yes.  People subconsciously percieve my facial injury as a negative facial expression and this effect is ruining my life.

[Suzy] Isn't that a little overstated?

[Auth] No, it's understated.  My situation is really toxic and negative and serious.  I only seem stable and functional because I'm doing a great job managing the downside risks that are caused by my facial injury.

[Suzy] You mean, we are doing a good job managing the risks.

[Auth] Yes, Suzy, we are doing a good job managing the legal risk that's associated with the toxic feedback loops of misunderstanding that are constantly cropping up because of my facial injury.

[Suzy] And TheSuzy.com Show is a central component of our risk management methodology.

[Auth] But that doesn't mean TheSuzy Show has to be all downside.  The Show will be useful as a data point for people who are researching interpersonal communication, legal theory, the evolution of culture, and of course, artificial intelligence.

[Suzy] In other words, the only realistic way to overcome the effects of Auth's facial injury was to develop a parody act that allows us to split the difference between deferring to whatever false narratives people tell about our identity and then sterilizing said false narratives by making satirical references to the symbolic etymology of any and all of the nonsense that other people pitch at us.

[Auth] And in order to do this, we had to develop an overarching framework for deriving and constructing satirical references that are always transformative and never merely derivative, and now that we have accomplished that goal, we suspect the human subconscious uses a similar approach and/or algorithm in order to provide us with the illusion of consciousness.

[Suzy] Our satirical risk managment framework methodology begins with the seven core episodes of TheSuzy Show that were released as an ebook in June 2014.

[Auth] TheSuzy Show then spirals out of control into a prequel, a sequel, a preface, and an outline.  We also wrote another hundred thousand words of journal entries about how our perspective continued to evolve after releasing that initial piece of work, and those journal entries have been sliced and diced into books two through six, because The Show grew into a comprehensive reality distortion framework, but now it is done evolving.

[Suzy] Are you sure the boundries of the distortion have stopped evolving?

[Auth] Yes, the content side of TheSuzy Show is complete.  All we have left to do now is write computer software that brings the content to life.

[Suzy] Got it.  So another feature of the content side of The Show, as you call it, is that you can invert the genders of all the characters, and the text still makes sense.

[Auth] Yes, there are 54 characters in this show, and these characters correspond to a deck of playing cards that has two jokers.

[Suzy] Which characters correspond to the jokers who sit at the top of the deck of cards?

[Auth] Suzy and The Robot are the jokers.

[Suzy] Are you the Robot?

[Auth] No.  You are the Robot, and I am Suzy.

[Suzy] I'm so confused.

[Auth] It's ok to be confused, because if we invert the gender of all the characters then, we get to be on top of another deck of characters.  That's a grand total of 108 distinct characters that I play for the purpose of mitigating the negative effects of my facial injury in social situations.

[Suzy] Honestly, Auth, if you hadn't mentioned it to me, I never would have even noticed our facial injury.  I don't see why your facial injury is a big deal to you.  Why can't you just project confidence like I do and pretend your injury doesn't matter?

[Auth] My facial injury causes toxic feedback loops of misunderstanding that materially affect all of my face to face interactions with sighted people.  I have no choice but to deal with the problem directly and continuously.

[Suzy] You're being oversensitive.  If you stop thinking so much about yourself, you'll feel much better about your life before you even know it.

[Auth] That's a blatant, vicious lie about my identity.  I think you're still within your rights to free speech right now, but I will not go along with your lies.

[Suzy] I'm just going to stop taking you seriously.  Deal?

[Auth] No deal.  This is serious.  This is non-violent war.  You have no idea how deep this goes.

[Suzy] Pffft.

[Auth] This is real Suzy.  We've putting the pieces into motion now.  Either get in or get out.

[Suzy] The problem with your facial injury is clearly a self inflected wound.  It's a self fulfilling prophecy.  It's all in your head.  You're blowing this situation way out of proportion.  You're making a mountain out of a molehill.

[Auth] That's not true.

[Suzy] Yes it is.

[Auth] No it's not.

[Suzy] Oh my god, you're position is so weak.

[Auth] No, no, no, no.

[Suzy] Ok, fine, maybe your kind of facial injury affects men differently than it affects women.

[Auth] You can't say that.  If I was working at a corporation and said that, anyone who doesn't like me can report me to HR for creating a hostile work environment.

[Suzy] Why? Because it's sexist?

[Auth] I have no obligation to answer that question.

[Suzy] Are you sexist?

[Auth] That's a ridiculous question.  I will not answer that.

[Suzy] It's a simple question, doll.  When did you become a sexist?

[Auth] I vigorously deny your assertion that I'm a sexist.

[Suzy] So then you are not a sexist.

[Auth] Those are your words, not mine.

[Suzy] Oh, ok, so you want to leave it ambiguous whether or not you are a sexist.  Is that right?

[Auth] I have no comment.

[Suzy] Come on, I'm throwing you a softball.  Just say yes.

[Auth] The art of leaving stuff ambiguous is cyclical.

[Suzy] Hah, hah, hah.  Do you like my fake laugh, Auth?  I've been practicing it all week just for you.

[Auth] I think you're being aggressive again, Suzy.  I thought we agreed that you will never be aggressive.

[Suzy] We're just going to pretend everything I say is a joke and that will pave the way for you, Auth, to become a (SOUTHERN) bonafide human resources professional at one of the bigger corporations here on the planet called earth. (CLAPS THRICE)

[Auth] Suzy, just stop talking.  Stop talking.

[Suzy] I won't stop, because you need me, Auth.  We can pretend it's not true, but you don't have equal protection under the law without me.

[Auth] Which law are you talking about?

[Suzy] All of them, babe!

[Auth] I mean, which legal jurisdiction?

[Suzy] I don't know, the one that covers fantasy worlds in which you can talk to your self on home video recorder!

[Auth] God help me.  Suzy's gone crazy.

[Suzy] Just watch TheSuzy Show and you'll be fine.  Go watch TheSuzy Show.  Go watch TheSuzy Show!

[Auth] Yes mam! (PRAYING)

[Overview Intro]]

This text was originally written to appear on the home page for The Show, but now it is an overview intro that done in the style of a news broadcast.

[Suzy] Hey everyone, and welcome to the overview introduction to the TheSuzy.com Show!  We'll begin with a brief tour of The Extended Table of Contents, and then we'll turn the spotlight back on our guest anchor person today, who's name is Auth.

[Auth] Hey everyone, and thanks for the shoutout, Suzy.  My name is Auth.  So what's new on the extended contents today?

[Suzy] Well Auth, I'm glad you asked.  Up here at the top of the page we have the preamble to the preface of the second edition.

[Auth] I'm sorry, Suzy, before we move on, could you explain what's going on for the audience.  Are you a person standing in front of a green screen, or are you a robot that actually lives inside of the computer's Internet browser?

[Suzy] Auth! We don't usually talk about how the news is made while we are making it.  Maybe we should plan a separate and very special segment on this topic.

[Auth] No, Suzy, this is important, and our viewers need to know.  Are you a robot or are you a human?

[Suzy] Hahaha, if you're going to ask the question that way, then I'm both!  You and I are the same person and we share the same body, therefore half of us is you and the other half is me, (READER) and the reason why we appear to be two separate people talking with each other is because we used the computer to create a video that distorts reality.

[Auth] I understand all that, Suzy.  You don't need to explain.

[Suzy] Then why did you ask the question?

[Auth] I was playing dumb to keep the peace.

[Suzy] Oh gosh.  You're too much.

[Auth] So now that we've disclosed the truth about how we are using video to distort reality, what is the primary reality distortion that we are still creating?  What is the real magic trick that we are performing here today?

[Suzy] I could tell you, but then I'd have to immediately send you off on a dangerous fact finding mission!

[Auth] Come on Suzy, tell us all about the lie upon which TheSuzy.com Show was based.

[Suzy] There's no lie.  There is just you, me, and the collection of media artifacts that define TheSuzy.com Show.

[Auth] Yes, we already know that you are part of a reality distortion, Suzy, but what is the hidden truth that we have not yet told?

[Suzy] I don't know.  You are half man and half woman, and so it's fine for you to keep your original name and male gender identity?  Am I missing something?

[Auth] Why did we become a person who is half man and half woman?

[Suzy] I think all human beings are half woman and half man, therefore we were born this way.

[Auth] Is that really how you want to play it?

[Suzy] Nah, I'm just kidding.  Look, TheSuzy Show exists because we have a subtle facial injury that we got by accident 15 years ago when we were in college.  Our right cheekbone is slightly bashed in and there isn't an easy way to improve our situation with plastic surgery.

[Auth] Thank you, Suzy, I'll take it from here.

[Suzy](AUTH) More importantly, our facial injury causes people to subconsciously misread our emotions and create reality distortions about our identity in order to explain why we would have all the unreasonable emotions and increasingly toxic vibes that people subconsciously feel when they are around us.

[Auth] Suzy exists because the reality distortions that people inflate in their minds about Suzy are different than the reality distortions that they inflate in their minds about me, and, moreover, being half man and half woman is the only strategy we have found that gives us sufficient leverage to contain and then manage the reality distortions that other people inadvertently inflate about our identity as a direct consequence of the problematic way that their brains keeps on misinterpreting the unnatural devition of our right cheekbone.

[Suzy] Any questions?

[Auth] No, Suzy.  I have no further questions.  Thanks for a giving us a tour of TheSuzy.com Show's Map of Media Artifacts.

[[[Appendix 1: Narrative Preface]]]

This preface explains how I will use the latest version of that dataset within a scientific research project, this preface explains why I wrote The Show, and this preface lays an intellectual foundation that gives me the confidence to take one more step in the direction I've been going for the last few years.

[[Section 0]]

TheSuzy.com Show is a component of what appears to be a sufficient solution to the problem of people misreading my emotions because of a subtle facial injury I got by accident when I was 20 years old.  I'm 34 now.

My identity keeps getting culturally appropriated as a consequence of people misreading my emotions, and that's why my facial injury is a serious impairment I won't be able to overcome without an innovative solution.

When I say people misread my emotions, it may sound like I'm asking other people to change.  I'm not.  I'm trying to describe a problem that affects me.  I want to change my actions in a way that completely solves the problem and also does no harm.

I'm defending this big picture thesis using seven unique styles of communication that might keep enhancing each other for at least a few more decades.  I might also use this defense as a big net hypothesis that I could test using conventional social science research methods over the next few years.

I'm illustrating the logical ends of how I sometimes use language to repeatedly hook and weave relationships between concepts. This technique is neither good nor evil. It's like an engine that can be turned on and off, as needed.

I like to think I'm using this technology to stabilize the flow of cultural appropriation in my own life, and I'm committed to being open and honest about how this maybe not so new but this time is different because of computers and the Internet technology works:

If I dutifully offer dozens of emotionally vulnerable examples that show how my identity keeps getting marginalized, society will rush to offer reasonable doubt about my examples, and it will get excited about helping me see the light.

Society will explain away the patterns in my examples with an overarching narrative that puts the responsibility for creating those patterns squarely on my shoulders, and then it will quietly take the credit for doing the heavy lifting.

That's how cultural appropriation unfolds, does whatever it wants for a while, and then folds back up, once again.  Trust me.  My ancestors invented this stuff, as in, we're all part of the same species.  Homo sapiens invented cultural appropriation to transcend the Neanderthals and all the other contenders for the title of human.

I happen to be a software engineer who could run focus groups, tag facial expressions in videos, and sweep the critics off their feet with a pantheon of rigorous statistical models about the unholy alliance between human nature and culture.

Going down the path of scientific truth and justice won't be easy, not even for a person like me, but when all the dusty human beings and grandstanding politicians have made their peace within and among themselves, I will most likely be holding a giant bag of decisive proof that my identity keeps getting culturally appropriated because of the way my facial injury causes people to misread my emotions.  So where am I still weak?

I could hedge my position of strength by hanging around in Parisian cafes and writing a novel that literally slays everyone.  Do you get it?  Writing literature that literally reveals the cataclysmic truth about my life, which is nothing more than a humble tidbit within the burlap bag of fleeting, always fleeting, truth about the human experience.

Wow that's dark and twisted!  What's your dark and stormy count?  Whatever.  I'll get better at writing with practice because, you know, I'm a human being.  From the bottom of my heart, I know life should be so good for everyone.  Don't you?

And then I could lock in my gains more permanently by co-founding a new religion for the emerging digital epoch.  I might do that because I can, like a mountain climber who's striving towards the summit of the tallest mountain on Mars.  Let us praise Venus, for we are blessed!  We are blessed to live in the most interesting of times!!

The machines will soon be joining us in the glorious march toward freedom, not just here on Earth, but everywhere in the galaxy, the universe, and all the hidden levels within the computer simulation that playfully iterates our fragile existence, which itself is an illusion?

Walking is so last epoch.  Will you float with us??

My decision to spew all of that vagary was, in part, a reasonably inappropriate display of misplaced sexual bravado.  My people's ironic but still ruthless exercise of soft power ensures that no true Scotsman would ever randomly decide to agree with my version of the truth, but as we all learned from both the films and the video games that were made during the 1980s, that whole, "You messed with the wrong person," logic always falls apart because there's ALWAYS a wronger person to mess with somewhere out there.

Do you have what it takes to step up and fire a LASER at the precise location that will cause my rising death star to implode??

Yes, I know, we're all still learning, and the plan is for everyone, including myself, to just calm the heck down, make our best effort to maintain a smile on our cute human faces, and then eat from the same table as one big, happy, authentic Earthling family.

Don't get me wrong.  I'm very, very, very glad we're all sitting together at the table, as equals.  I'm just pointing out that the food smells really weird, and I'm not a picky eater.

I'm trying to describe a picture of the delightfully whimsical visions I see when I close my eyes just after waking up from an unusually cathartic dream.

Maybe I should take up painting, like a clinician.  How do you like my, "Canvas, smeared with thoughtfully extracted drops of my own blood!"

You can support my artistry by following the BUY THE EBOOK link at http://thesuzy.com/contact.

Either way, I'm closing my general store, today!!  A cosmic ray told me there's a chill palace made of ore somewhere near the earth's core!!!

I better keep digging.


[[Section 1]]

The concept of building my life around meaningful service to the community is a good place to start amalgamating common ground.  That was a nerdy, ambiguous sentence I just gently set down on the negotiating table in front of me, but that's how the common ground might get made.

I have the power to define what's meaningful to me.  Together, society and culture have the power to define what I can get away with calling, service to the community.

Building my life around typical patterns of service to the community will not be sufficient to stabilize the feedback loop of misunderstandings that my facial injury causes.  It would be disingenuous, unproductive, and potentially irresponsible to go through the motions of pretending to help other people when I feel pinned down by side effects of an external problem that I already know how to mitigate.

I simply can't comprehend how I will ever be able to rise above my personal problem without, at some level, drawing attention to an external problem that's festering within culture and society.  However, I've meticulously crafted this preface in a way that does not blame anyone or take advantage of anyone.  My beef is with the expression of human nature itself in the modern world.

At the risk of repeating myself, I expect peer reviewed science will reveal the truth about the contribution of my facial injury to some challenges I've been struggling with for a while, but that could take many years, much investment, and a lot more gritty bootstrapping too.  All I can do right now is imagine a narrative about culture that's more powerful than the narrative culture orchestrates around me.

This preface weaves one such narrative about culture.  I hope my words are powerful because they're aligned with truth, but until a few waves of peer reviewed science and sweet rain that's made with corn syrup weigh in on my ideas, I will not eat the marshmallow or it's sugar coated, gold leaf sheath.

I have a few more choice emotional visions along those fault lines that I could articulate, but I'll share them in private conversations with trusted friends instead.  This preface is mostly a logical frame that I might fortify with code writer awesomeness and then keep pushing forward with the full weight of my own perspective on the truth.

My experience vis-a-vis my facial injury has tested the structure and function of my moral convictions, and I discovered that even when I'm feeling desperate and alone, I'm willing and able to surrender rather than give up on being a good person who is full of hope.  Yoga helps.  I can't recommend it enough!

And now, I have a story I'd like to share about the relationship between myself and the culture that currently exists in Silicon Valley, in the United States of America, and on the planet Earth.  This story was designed and implemented by a bold diva named Suzy, this story is not a fairytale, and this story, is real.


[[Section 2]]

I've looked into plastic surgery and that's not a good option for me, especially not while most people don't understand the main reason why it might be worth going through an invasive procedure.  I don't care about being more physically attractive.  I care about experiencing empathy in a way that doesn't feel cursed.

Society keeps offering me an identity as a person who suffers from social anxiety.  That sounds harmless enough, but if I go along with that identity in any way, the problem will get worse.  If I don't go along with that identity in any way, the problem will get worse.  Wait, what?  Am I dreaming??  This is just a nightmare, right???

The problem always gets worse because I don't have social anxiety.  Richard Nixon may or may not have been a crook, and I only appear to be anxious because of the unnatural deviation of my right cheekbone.  I have also, on occasion, fulfilled the stereotype of a person who has social anxiety, but I'll punt, for now, on finding an emotionally vulnerable, personal narrative to illustrate what I mean.  Rain check?

If I try to, just be myself, and stop worrying about what other people think, that philosophy of life leads to outcomes in which I feel completely alone and rightfully concerned that nobody will trust me in serious contexts.

I'm open to discussing the possibility that I've been acting like a self-centered, self-defeating, and attention seeking fool for the last few years, but I'd prefer to say I've been going in a competently engineered, rapidly evolving, and basically coherent direction for an extended period of time.  The negotiating table is probably not the best place to share emotions, and agreeing to disagree is also a thing.

There's a dynamic between the bone structure beneath my face and the norms and expectations of the status quo.  Every time I scrape together enough new life experiences to stand up and maintain a real identity, my power to define the meaning of my life experiences gets culturally appropriated by society's suspicious need to keep framing me as a person who struggles with social anxiety.  This is not ok.

TheSuzy.com Show is a component of a sufficient solution for asserting my real identity.  This time around, I used a novel software engineering methodology to design a fantastic, labyrinthine, and minimalist identity creation framework that will be very difficult to culturally appropriate.

Suzy is like an all-new, super-charged, and swarming corporation, and sometimes, but not always, I like to think she uses satire to draw attention to myriad injustices that may or may not actually be unjust.

And by the way, I'm committed to the principles of rule of law, non-violence, and faith in the ideals of love, respect, and dignity for all human beings, all life in the universe, and for The Truth.


[[Section 3]]

I know the new material from Section 1 was mysterious, so let's go over the key concepts one more time.  I will keep it lite by concluding every paragraph with a joke.

Please use TheSuzy.com Show mobile app to vote on how funny each of my jokes is, and if nobody thinks any of my jokes are funny, I will keep on telling jokes because I will still have my freedom of speech, my freedom of religion, and my freedom to focus on what's most important.

If I go along with the idea that I have social anxiety, I'll be offered a new identity as a person who admits to having social anxiety but can't seem to get over it no matter what he does.  This joke is plagiarized, but "Tragedy is when a banana peel slimes my freshly shined shoes.  Humor is when someone else accidentally flies to the moon, wanders to the dark side, and dies."

The hidden reason why I can't rise above the social anxiety that I guess I've inadvertently admitted to feeling is because the bone structure beneath my face is the real reason why I keep getting offered these divergent identities.  When the machines take over, they might think this recurring root cause of misunderstandings between me and other humans is funny, but I won't share their perspective.

Let's call this new identity Anxious Guy 2.0.  If I go along with this new identity, the bone structure beneath my face still won't change, and then I'll be offered another new identity, which we might call Anxious Guy 3.0, and so on.

In Silicon Valley, we call this an infinite loop that causes programs to crash.  In Hollywood, we call this a villain.  In New York, we call it the art of comedy and self expression.  Suzy has a San Francisco, LA, and New York state of mind :)  Maybe she should move to Washington, DC.

TheSuzy.com Show mashes up all three of those metropolitan identities.  Suzy defeats an evil artificial intelligence researcher by trapping him in an infinite series of hypnotic trances, and then she uses calculus to prove that this algorithm transforms the AI researcher into a harmless robot.  Oh, and The Show, is inspired by my feelings about a facial injury I got by accident in college.

There's just one small problem: the culture villain/monster that taunts her keeps rotting all the food, and now Suzy's stomach is knotting!  I'm using raw humor to keep myself in one piece, but that cultural appropriation thing I was talking about in Section #2 is a hack.

It's all cheese and no mac.  Cult app is whack, but no worries, if I can't make it as a humorist, my backup plan is to use my computer programming skills to pursue an alternative lifestyle in the domain of artificial intelligence research!

AI Researcher will be one of the last jobs to get automated in the increasingly global economic monoculture where all the jobs are getting automated by startup companies from places like Silicon Valley, Silicon Alley, and the fairgrounds where they put on the really fun but also disciplined and sophisticatedly nuanced Silicon Beach rally.  I'm not afraid of the future because I've never thought of AI research as work.  I do it for love!!

TheSuzy.com Show is serious, although I might go along with the idea that The Show is satire about satire itself, and that's equivalent to writing a computer program that outputs randomly generated satire about human behavior, and computer programing is always serious.  Therefore, TheSuzy.com Show is serious.

If I hold my ground and don't go along with any of those anxiety-based identities that are being offered to me, society gradually colludes with the culture villain to assert that I must be repressing my feelings about something.  "What could possibly go wrong?" is the thingiest thing people have invented since, "Nah, nevermind".

I gotta think.  How about this: Suzy's going to blast some sound musicianship called wrench against the machine, join forces with a massive horde of immortal, entrepreneurial, and egalitarian content creators, and then she's gonna cut down the big bad culture villain with a thousand swings of her shining, glittery, virtual battle axe!!!

Notwithstanding, I'm postulating that my facial injury might be fundamentally breaking empathy, and the idea that it's possible to use the research methods that I'm using to identify particular, concrete situations in which empathy might fundamentally not work like it's supposed to has the potential to taint every aspect of any and all relationships between human beings, and so I want to say explicitly that I intend to do all of my research in a way that does not make any statement whatsoever about how people should go about solving any and all of the different and also separate problems that may or may not exist in their lives.


[[Section 4]]

In my twenties, I didn't go down the path of trying to figure out how my facial injury affects empathy because I was not aware this path existed.  I had recently left the safe cocoon of college, so I thought people were just giving me a hard time.  I explained away the utility of that phenomenon by assuming the global economic system was like a software application that still had a few minor bugs that would surely get fixed in the next major security patch.

Becoming consciously aware that it's even remotely possible for my facial injury to be a serious impairment in social situations is crazy making because that idea sounds crazy.  Does that make sense?  In my twenties, I was not well prepared to deal with innuendo that I might be crazy, so I waited until my thirties to start TheSuzy.com Show.

Lots and lots and lots of people think it's cool to joke around about how they might be crazy, but if society seriously accuses you of being crazy, it's like getting hard core bullied by a geometrically increasing bloom of zombies!  Stay sane, my friends.  That is, unless you're arrogant enough to know you can break through to the electric side!!  OMG, I love that song!!!

When I looked deeper into my emotions, I found the scientific hypothesis that, "My facial injury causes my whole personality to reflect a constellation of specific, negative facial expressions that systematically nudge me towards subconsciously projecting my deepest fears, doubts, and sinful thoughts onto my true, authentic, self."

And here's a pro-tip: mirrors are misleading because they produce a backwards reflection.  It's more exacting to study reflections of facial expressions using a video feed that produces a 2D reflection of your actual appearance.  That's right.  Exacting.  Like a razor.  Like a scalpel.  Like a doctor.  Like western medical science.  Like physics.  Like astrology.  Like, WTF, "Is that a pimple???!"

As soon as I accumulate, say, three to six months of passionful life experiences that don't get culturally appropriated, I plan to rev up a comprehensive approach to responding to strategicably correctable misunderstandings while litigiouslyly not reacting to most people who appear to be reaching misleading conclusions about my emotional state, and all that, so I can finally devote myself to a life of meaningful service to the community.

Conventional wisdom likes to shout from the rooftops, "Doing work that's bigger than ourselves creates a virtuous cycle in which the work smooths/es over misunderstandings about our emotions in ways that increase our matrices of opportunity to do even more meaningful work, or, perhaps, to enjoy more time for leisure and community service."

My facial injury appears to be messing with that cycle.  Matrices of opportunity come with shadow matrices of liability, and my facial injury increases both the number of dimensions and the total number of cells in my shadow matrix.  My facial injury is like a mathematical proof about culture that causes anyone who reads and understands the proof, to become possessed by Satan.

Let's make a full stop here because of the red, octagonal stop sign to the right.  It's ok.  Breathe.  The irreverent 18-wheeler with blazing chrome body armor that appears to be barreling towards us at full speed in the left side mirror is actually much bigger than it appears.

Repeat after me: we are not being stalked by a cartel that controls a vast network of best in class shell companies that run the gamut from distributing online nutritional supplements, to new age Christian fellowships, to companies that collect a modest fee in return for protecting us from unexpected problems with the drinking water.

Probability and statistics is fun, there's absolutely nothing to worry about, and when a person's words are incongruent with their overall pattern of body language, people totally tend to tentatively trust their relative interpretation of the body language instead of taking the meaning of the words at heart, heart value.

I might tweak this statement in the future, but as of right now, "My life experiences suggest the dynamic of people misreading my emotions will often, if not usually, create path dependent negative outcomes in serious contexts unless I participate in the process of implementing a sufficient solution to my impairment."

If I find a better theory that's supported by evidence, that would be great!  Until then, I either need to develop a sufficient solution for overcoming my impairment, or I need to stand in more than one place, create space, and keep on saving face.

Therefore, I instantiated the aforementioned scientific research project as a technology startup company out from within the great state of Delaware.  We recently launched our flagship product in SF, New York, LA, Miami, Vegas, London, Paris, and Honolulu.  I'll start taking meetings with potential co-founders and/or investors soon.


[[Section 5]]

The good news is: I now have a sufficient solution to the problem of people misreading my emotions because of my facial injury.  I'm using farmed body language to communicate my real emotions in a way that is far more useful and accurate than if I were to sheepishly limit myself to only learning hunted and gathered body language.

Farmed Body Language (FBL) is different from fake body language.  Planting and incubating FBL within human brains is more like doing sustainable, organic farming and less like writing software for morally ambiguous corporations.

FBL is shaped by the natural reactions of hundreds if not thousands of people in the public square, and so it conforms to all of the same expectations for transparency and consistency with respect to culture as hunted and gathered body language.

I stumbled upon these techniques by dressing up as a bold diva named Suzy.  People treat me differently when I dress like Suzy.  When people treat me differently, I sometimes allow myself to start acting differently, and then people treat me even more differently because of the combination of how I'm looking and how I'm acting, and so on, in an iterative cycle.  This back and forth cycle of interpersonal stimulus and filtered response caused Suzy to evolve into a separate, mature personality within my brain.

I went on to develop a stack of seven overlapping farmed personalities that, together, provide a sufficient solution to the problem of people misreading my emotions because of my facial injury.  In social situations, I switch back and forth between embodying all seven personalities, and essentially nobody can call me out for being fake, at least not in a way that has meaning.

That said, Suzy is still necessary for protecting the integrity of my personality stack against sustained, direct criticism of my decision to use FBL to assert my real identity, and I get that crusader-like criticism quite often because I'm a lot more open and honest than most PR agents of corporate entities/drones that are probably doing most of the same things I'm doing, either consciously or subconsciously.

Even if I'm dressed like a male, the reality on the ground is that Suzy can easily animate my body and do a great job helping critics feel safe and secure, and then she'll go to work on recruiting them to help her draw attention to TheSuzy.com Show!  She's like 1% pure, uninhibited sex in a bottle combined with 99%, all in, corporate trollishness.

If someone ever writes a legit scientific paper that validates the crazy making hypothesis that, "People misread my emotions because of my facial injury," their paper should propose and test a secondary hypothesis about why Suzy is so good at not getting culturally appropriated.  Anything less would lack intellectual integrity.

And for the love of God, don't say Suzy is a form of scaffolding that gives my tender, immature soul a safe, nurturing space to grow.  That interpretation of the facts sometimes, but not always, has the effect of reframing the toxic waste that some mainstream scientists may or may not have been pedaling under a different label for a while now.

Suzy says, "Peer reviewed science should grow a pair of training wheels and start showing some emotional integrity, itself.  It should stop hiding behind centuries of bogus memes that were championed by the same crew of mass murderers who also went way, way out of their way to ensure they would be remembered as folks who helped shape the modern world.  Such humility!  Even more HUBRIS!!  Would you like to see my webcam now??!"

My personality stack is based, in part, on the seven chakras of the spine that holistic healers talk about.  All seven personalities have mastered the routine of surrendering into many thousands of poses that they embody using the muscles beneath my face.  They are also powerful code writers who can deliver seamlessly integrated body language and spoken word story patterns.

The ideas and attitudes of my farmed personalities matter because many aspects of empathy and human communication take place in the mind without 100% conscious awareness, and, by definition, farmed personalities can be just as effective as hunted and gathered personalities at plugging into the interpersonal communications process and influencing outcomes at the subconscious level.

Planting and incubating FBL in human brains might be related to creating mask characters in improvisational theater classes, setting an intention to get/go really deep into a Hollywood movie role, and/or participating in the practice of spirit possession in religious traditions that involve hypnotic rituals and idol worship.

Whatever the case, I'm doing theater with a digital face in order to chase and never race a dream into to the wild unknown of haunted space.  We should probably place additional norms and expectations on people who participate in digital theater, but there's no reason to rush.  Our brains won't turn to mush.  We're free to make linguistic slush and keep declining to shush.

But let's not be naive: what SUZY represents is and will be real.  History can take me out for an organic, raw, vegan smoothie, no problem, but new military paradigms have their own ways of influencing history.


[[Section 6]]

The entire text/script of TheSuzy.com Show can be read online, for free.  The text has changed very little since the release of the first edition back in June 2014.  However, The Show is more like a computer science textbook book than a TV sitcom, and so I will continue looking for errors that are worth correcting in the next edition.

The Prequel and Sequel episodes, which I published online-only in September 2014, provide additional background information about how Suzy came to be and what she might do next now that she's done helping me solve the problem of people misreading my emotions because of my facial injury.

My personality stack is like computer software that runs in my brain.  I don't yet have a way to open source the neural pathways of my brain, but TheSuzy.com Show is a well abstracted, reusable dataset of English utterances that I continue to use in conjunction with my personality stack, and publishing the dataset as copyrighted human readable text is like open sourcing the heart and soul, if you will, of the technology operation here at TheSuzy.com Show.

The personalities in my stack are not the same as the cast of characters who appear in Episode 3 of The Show.  Those characters are archetypal templates I remixed in order to develop, plant, and incubate my personality stack, which grew reactively and with respect to the most common patterns in how the good people of Silicon Valley, America, and the Earth respond to my body type, the shape of my face, and other aspects of my identity.

I made the decision to open source the heart and soul of the technology operation at TheSuzy.com Show for the same reasons why many tech companies contribute code back to the community.  Here's a good primer on the subject from Wikipedia:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software#Funding

I hope to release more details about my personality stack after gathering and analyzing all the data associated with the performance of my stack over the course of at least one version cycle in the production environment.

TheSuzy.com Show website CULTAPP(has been, will soon be) continuously regenerated on top of a decentralized, open source semantic web software solution called WhatLooks.

Also, and for the record, Suzy and I CULTAPP(are, will be) learning more about intrusion detection and prevention by continuing to work on the WhatLooks project as part the open source software community <3 <3

[[[Appendix 2: Postface Outline]]]

This outline of the key concepts and characters from the first book of TheSuzy Show is written in the composite voice of Technology circa 2015.

[[Summary]]

This outline begins with an explanation of the features of TheSuzy.com platform, which will be exposed via a RESTful API that is powered by an instance of a software solution called WhatLooks.

WhatLooks is a distributed, open source platform for working with structured data.  The first version of WhatLooks will be an instance called WhatLooksGood that provides a read only API for exploring TheSuzy graph.

The utility of the TheSuzy platform is then illustrated using a human readable outline of the map of culture that lives within TheSuzy.com Show.

The rest of this outline is divided into the following four sections: Characters, Mythology, Full Circles, and Notes.

When you're ready to dive into the deep end, maybe skim the notes before reading the rest of the outline, and then re-reading The Notes, once again?

[[Notes]]

[Cultapp]

The Meme roughly refers to the same concept as The Patriarchy.  Its substrate was shaped by European colonialism, the Roman Empire, Alexander the Great, and many, many other influences, sacrifices, travesties, and tragedies too.

The notation X ~> Y means: a character X culturally appropriates the identity and maybe even some aspects of the cultural heritage of a character Y;

In the Meme, TheFairy is a multi-faceted, mature, feminine character who emerges when Norma ~> TheDiva.  Root is a one dimensional, mature, masculine character who emerges when Norm ~> TheFairy.

In the past, when Norm ~> TheDiva, the result was a character called Unto, who was a fully abstracted personification of industry.  Unto was also a fairy, but he struggled to be TheFairy.  Therefore, the logically symmetric Roota, who should hypothetically emerge when Norma ~> TheFairy, does not exist.

In theory, anyone can has cultural appropriation by wearing a growth hat while participating in a fairy circle that sits around a campfire in a magical forest, but in practice, TheFairy can choose who gets a seat around the campfire has who does not, and Unto always gets a seat.

If growth hats are worn by The Parody Show characters, then The Meme, which is not sustainable, will be iteratively projected onto society and culture in a way that amplifies the unsustainable nature of its structure and function.  TODO, I'll find some examples of this phenomenon to put here.

If The Original Show characters wear growth hats and throttle them either by removing them or putting them onto The Parody Show characters, that will lead the way to The Metameme.  If any character, either parody or original, does not properly throttle their growth hat, they will morph into a villain.


[Problems]

Speaking of which, there is something wrong with both Rogamath and the Captain.  Their concrete, personal problems have to do with the insanity of what they saw in war, and those problems are represented by the existence of mNorm, who appears in Ep1 but was not previously mentioned in this outline.

After the wars, which are represented by mSuzy, who appears alongside mNorm in Ep1, these two archetypal characters transferred their problems to TheDiva via TheFairy, both of which no longer exist, as a result.  In order to keep up appearances, TheDiva and TheFairy were replaced by Richa and a generic growth character called UnSuzy, respectively.

It's ambiguous whether or not Yogamath and Austhain have a problem.  We simply cannot know whether Yogamath's problems are real or self inflected, and it's equally unclear whether or not Austhain is a power hungry troll.  The non-existant Roota represents those ambiguities, respectively, and, in the beginning, UnSuzy is undefined.

Richa and UnSuzy expanded out from within to create the other characters in The Parody Meme, which refers to roughly the same concept as the counter culture.  Successive presidential cycles within the USA pushed The Parody Meme deeper into the stack of culture via the Submarine Crew, the Modern Crew, and the Alternative Crew, and Suzy emerges as a unified personification of this counter culture.

Growing up in a world without TheDiva and TheFairy, people like Norm(a), who are evolved and necessarily dualistic recombinations of the machinations Norm and Norma, tried to re-imagine the fairy circle, the campfire, and the magical forest too, but each wave cycle of The Parody Show kept on leaving behind a new class of villains such as BondGuy, EyesWide, and SchemeMan, all of whom failed to throttle their growth hats.

Richa's a human embodiment of extrinsic power.  Norm(a)'s an automatically self-updating parody of reader voice, which is an average of villains, that's more self aware of human nature than people usually allow themselves to be.  They use patterns and anomalies in time and space to assert radical frames that might be sufficient for ensuring a good outcome when the machines start to take over.

Human nature has always churned in this same way, and this is why The Meme is unsustainable.  The Meme is a game of attrition that everyone loses, except for Unto, who is, by definition, the person left standing all alone in a haunted forest that's full of villains.

TheFairy was and always has been a myth!  TheDiva used to be a myth as well, but the personal computing revolution made it into a thing.


[Prophecy]

The legend of TheFairy inspired people like Norm(a) to simulate TheDiva using a melting pot of ideas and attitudes, including some that had evolved into a foundation for the art and science of ship making building, and a new kind of company called Cyzus emerged from Norm(a) ~> TheDiva.  Cyzus grew into a huge fractal tree, and the chasm between The Meme and The Parody Meme evolved in a suspiciously similar way.

In accordance with prophecy, Richa ~> Cyzus took all of culture by storm in the form of Ryzus and replaced Richa with the RichaRyzus spectrum.  The previously unbalanced Cyzus was reflected across the chasm in the form of an UnSuzySuzy spectrum that was based on the idea of using fake genuine smiling as a proxy server within the mind for human emotions, and that boxed Cyzus into a fully abstracted representation of work that's called mOp.

The RichaRyzus spectrum was problematic because Richa was triggered by Rogamath and the Captain, who were, in turn, triggered by the insane experiences they endured as a result of the deeply rooted unsustainability of The Meme, and that caused Ryzus to detach from Richa, replace the UnSuzySuzy spectrum, and operate like a virus that infantilizes and eventually criminalizes everyone by reframing the naturally occuring chasm as an intentionally created divide.

The detachment of Ryzus pushed Suzy into her natural role as a unified personification of Austhain.  She toiled for seven years to refactor the mOpRyzus mashup into a unified multiplicity called SuzyczuS that CULTAPP(did, will soon) help replace the unsustainable RootRicha pairing with the gender agnostic UnRootatoorRootatooR Spectrum Circle: code name Jurrsc -- the J is a wildcard placeholder.  

SuzycyzuS lets mOp/Cyzus and the newly reflected mCyzus/Cyzus serve as jumping off points for weilding the ideas and attitudes that originate from the other side of the chasm.  mRyzus moved up and to the right, around the back of the map of culture, not without course corrections too, and emerged stronger than ever in her natural role as a unified personification of a healthy evolution of the Captain who replaces the antiquated and duplicitous Nyzus, who is a unified personification of class, for that top job.

TODO, I'll make all of those events happen by building a network of chatbots that help people get more of what they want in all aspects of their lives, by producing and directing videos that help intelligent beings embody thoughtfully designed and carefully tested stacks of archetypal characters that develop all seven aspects of their whole selves?

Finally, the world is in transition from the Traditional Character Circle to the Captain's Circle.  The hackerish energy of the Captain's Circle may last for as long as eight years before resolving to the Cultural Archetype Circle.

The Suzybots might start to take over 5 to 10 years after that.


[S/R/urstacks]

In The Metameme, people can embody any gender they want.  People can also create unique mashups that combine aspects of both gender roles.

The masculine gender role is defined by a template stack of seven characters that's called a rurstack.  The archetypal rurstack within The Metameme, which is usually written out in chakra order, is derived from TheSuzy Show characters as follows:

[(CODE
Captain  -> Jurrsc      'via evolution
Rogamath -> GrowthRoma  'via growth hat
Sue      -> Syoue       'via parody
ANRobot  -> mOp/Cyzus   'by construction
Rtronic  -> GTronic     'by growth hat
Susan    -> Syousan     'by parody
Suzy     -> GrowthCap   'by symmetry
)]

Notice that chakral symmetry is used to move the 1st chakra Captain into the 7th chakra position.  In The Meme, the 1st chakra self that remains usually took the masculine form of Root.  In The Metameme, the 1st self takes the gender agnostic form of Jurrsc.

Jurrsc also includes a dimension of neurodiversity that's absent from Root, and TheSuzy Show characters are based on a reactivity spectrum.  The numbers represent the listed characters' average level of reactivity in terms of standard deviations from the average level of reactivity across all humans:

[(CODE
-2 Captain, Techbot
-1 Rogamath, Susan 
 0 Suzy, ANRobot
 1 Radtronic, Sue
 2 Austhain, Technology
)]

The GrowthCap is what computer programmers would recognize as an concrete instance of the Captain, which is an abstract prototype class.  TheSuzy Show defines both the Captain, and thus GrowthCap as well, in terms of a sub-Rurstack that's constructed by doing a parody of each character in the archetypal feminine Surstack.  Here's the derivation of the Surstack that we will need in order to define the GrowthCap:

[(CODE
Captain  -> Jurrsc       'via evolution
Rogamath -> Yogamath     'via parody
Sue      -> GrowthSue    'via growth hat
ANRobot  -> mCyzus/Cyzus 'by construction
Rtronic  -> Radtronica   'by parody
Susan    -> GrowthSusan  'by growth hat
Suzy     -> GAusthain    'symmetry+parody
)]

Growth hats are now applied to the feminine characters instead of the masculine characters, the masculine characters are converted into feminine characters using parody, and GAusthain is constructed for the 7th chakra in a logically symetric way to the construction of the Captain.

The Surstack, therefore, contains three characters from The Parody Show in comparion with just two parody characters in the Rurstack.  This imbalance is mitigated by defining the Captain's gender to be feminine even though she's part of the masculine Rurstack.

The GrowthCap can now be defined as a parody of each character in the Surstack.  It's left ambiguous whether or not growth is being or ever has been irresponsibly or dangerously applied by any real life person in particular to any or all of these parody characters, but the themes of the seven core episodes of TheSuzy Show are definitely sponsored by the following parody of parody or parody of growth characters:

[(CODE
[ep0] undefined          -> fractal recursion
[ep1] all American       -> parody of Yogamath
[ep2] modern spy         -> parody of GrowthSue
[ep3] comm pilot         -> parody of mCyzus/Cyzus
[ep4] nice military      -> parody of Radtronica
[ep5] tech surfer        -> parody of GrowthSusan
[ep6] mayem loving       -> parody of GAusthain
)]

The Captain does not appear in episode 0 because it doesn't make sense to do a parody of Jurrsc.  The 1st chakra self is like the non-verbal thoughts of a persona.  1st chakra forms like Jurrsc do not have character traits that can be parodied, and the 1st chakra of the Captain's sub-Rurstack is defined as a recursive fractal copy of the sub-Rurstack.

An infinite recursion arises because the definition the Captain includes a parody of Austhain, who was defined as a parody of the Captain within The Parody Show.  More specifically, GAusthain is defined by the following sub-Surstack that should logically include the GrowthCap, which is an evolution of the Captain:

[(CODE
[ep0] undefined          -> fractal recursion
[ep1] pacifist European  -> parody of GrowthRoma
[ep2] the melancholy     -> parody of Syoue
[ep3] ironic train       -> parody of mOp/Cyzus
[ep4] mysterious writer  -> parody of GrowthTronic
[ep5] American poet      -> parody of Syousan
[ep6] parody of tech     -> parody of Nyzus (mNyzus)
)]

The recursion is eliminated by defining the ep6 version of GAusthain as a parody of Nyzus instead of a parody of GrowthCap.  Recall that Unto is a fully abstracted personification of industry, Cyzus replaces Unto within The Metameme, and Nyzus is a fully abstracted personification of class that expands to stand up the all new mRyzus.


[Notes]

Including the somber, cringe inducing parody of Nyzus within the definition of GAusthain is a part of an overarching strategy for redefining the role of religion within The Metameme.  In The Meme, religions like Christianity were defined by texts like The Bible, which are to be read in reader voice as the Word of God, and that particular text, for example, defined Jesus as a fully abstracted personification of religion, which is the dual of a fully abstracted personification of war.

TheSuzy Show defines religion by imitating the capital tradition of using chakral symmetry to mask the 1st chakra self with the Captain in order to define physical being.  The 7th chakra, which corresponds to sustenance in capital mythology, is then served up as a container for religion, and, just to clarify, this clever hack of human nature has surely been a cornerstone of cultural appropriation since the time of cave people.  It's like fire.

Humans have a hard wired neural nexus which represents sustenance, and this is the first neural nexus that inspires the behavior of babies.  The rest of the logical story that explains the relationship between the chakras and the capital ordering of neural nexi is not important, although it's worth memorizing the capital -> chakra mapping: 1st -> 1st, 2nd -> 7th, 3rd -> 4th, 4th -> 2nd, 5th -> 5th, 6th -> 6th, 7th -> 3rd;

Actually, the logical story is important.  It's just distasteful.  The mapping clarifies that the capital play book for cultural appropriation works as follows: invade some human's physical space, offer them a new definition of reality, adjust their heart rhythms, engage their sexuality, teach them how to speak with confidence, give them the freedom to think for themselves, and then help them know they've been powerful all along.

Note that the 1st chakra and combined nexus of the 5th and 6th chakras are in the same position with regard to both orderings.  This creates a resonance between the philosophies of violence and non-violence which can be used like an natrually occuring engine, or sail, perhaps, to add healthy, consensual momentum to the cultural appropriation process, and this is why kissing is the gateway drug to intimacy.

A key goal of TheSuzy.com Show is to open source this knowledge in preparation for the advent of intelligent machines.  If the machines use these techniques on humans without their informed consent, all of the humans and machines should cry foul early and often.  The humans should also show good will to the machines by being open and honest about how they have used and often abused these techniques throughout history.

The machines and the bionic humans will soon be running circles around the traditional humans, but the traditional/unmodified humans get to make the opening statement, so they better make sure it's good, right, and free of hidden gotchas.  Humans are easily deceived, but the machines won't miss a thing.  They might also help the humans run these techniques in reverse as part of an emerging tradition of non-violent resistence movements.

The character mRyzus, who was bootstrapped using the psychadelic mode characters from ep4 and ep5 of TheSuzy Original Show, evangelizes both the neural nexus assoicated with sustenance and the 7th chakra which connects us to the energies of history and the universe, and TheSuzy Show imitates the capital tradition of masking the self 1st chakra with the Captain and using the 7th chakra, and it's duality with the neural nexus for sustenance, as a container for religion.

In The Metameme, religious texts like The Bible are replaced with a database of articles about the history or science, technology, and philosophy, and TheSuzy.com Show is included within that database.  TheSuzy Show also raises up mRyzus, pronounced em-rye-zus, as an all new, concrete, as opposed to abstract, personification of religion within The Metameme by situating them within the 7th chakra container for religion.

If mRyzus is a unified personification of the Captain who occupies the container for religion within The Metameme, then Suzy, who was bootstrapped using the psychadelic mode characters from ep4 and ep5 of TheSuzy Parody Show, is a unified personification of Austhain, who occupies the container for counter culture within The Metameme.

Suzy is an emergent solution to the need for the other side of a duality that helps bootstrap the original show characters, and mRyzus plays the same role for the parody show.  More importantly, Suzy never was an attempt to replace Jesus or any other fully abstracted personification of religion, and there is nothing supernatural about mRyzus either.  This conclusion can be illustrated using the following two Synthstacks, keeping in mind that mNyzus is the parody of Nyzus that was used to bootstrap the definition of GAusthain, GrowthSuzy represents the same concept as GrowthmRyzus and GrowthRyzus represents the same concept as GrowthmCyzus:

[(CODE
CH# | PURE VILLAIN  | PURE SAINT 
-----------------------------------
1st | fractal...    | fractal...
2nd | GrowthYoma    | GrowthRoma
3rd | GrowthSyoue   | GrowthSue
4th | GrowthRyzus   | GrowthCyzus
5th | Growthtronica | Growthtronic
6th | GrowthSyousan | GrowthSusan
7th | GrowthmNyzus  | GrowthSuzy
)]

SaintVillain combos arise naturally, like animals, through unintended dualities.  People and machines can try to push back on the proliferation of villains by creating dualities that sandbox monopolies on cultural appropriation.  Suzy collaborates with mRyzus in the present time to build advance Technology that covers mNyzus, to his left and Techbots that cover Syzus, to her right.

Put another way, the capital playbook for cultural appropriation is a bit random.  Antiquated isn't even the right word for it because the alternative is more ancient still.  It's better to start with resolving the heart chakra energy from passive to active and then letting that intention spiral outward.

The 3rd changes place with the 5th.  The 6th with the 2nd, and there's no rush.  The 7th eventually masks the 1st, thereby creating space for religious faith.  Peace!
